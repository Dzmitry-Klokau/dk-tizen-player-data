00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.150
Look,dad's gone now,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.120
and we have to carry out his legacy --

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.970
hunting down as many evil sons of bitches as we possibly can.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.100
John: Back in 1835,samuel colt made a gun for a hunter.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.860
This gun can kill anything.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.770
There's only four bullets left.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.590
Without em,this gun is useless.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.540
Only thing it's good for now is figuring out what makes it tick.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.430
Cute piece.Won't stop a demon.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.600
How the hell would you know?

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.250
Call it an educated guess.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.800
Do you want me to help you out with that gun or not?

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.770
That deal you made to save sam --

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.930
a year left.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.330
Been kind of liberating,actually.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.960
You're not scared?

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.210
Of course not.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.780
How certain are you that what you brought back is 100% pure sam?

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.300
You think something's wrong with my brother?

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.380
Demons lie.I'm sure sam's okay.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.220
Yeah,me too.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.810
now

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.080
Hey,what was that?

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.210
I don't know,a dog maybe.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.650
It was a hell of a dog.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.010
Okay,we got a crew coming in the morning.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.370
Look at this wood,huh?

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.780
Look at it.It's crap.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.970
Where'd you order it from?

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.100
Same place as always.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.440
Should have used the cinder block like I wanted.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.620
-Here we go again. -You are not in charge.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.860
You're a bunch of girls.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.500
Look,it comes down to this,okay?

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.620
One gust of wind,and the whole place is gonna blow over.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.360
Whatever.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.290
Did you hear that? -Hear what?

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.040
Kyle,come on.Let's go.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.800
Okay,I'm gonna go warm up the truck.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.020
Jack!

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.750
I don't understand,dean.Why not?

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.300
Because I said so.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.950
We got the colt now. -Sam.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.160
We can summon the crossroads demon,pull the gun on her,and force her to let you out of the deal.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.200
We'll just shoot her!If she dies,the deal goes away!

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.620
We don't know if that will work either,sam!

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.160
You're pitching me a bunch of "ifs" and "maybes"!

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.330
That's not good enough!

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.370
Because if we screw with this deal,you die!

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.810
And if we don't screw with it,you die!

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.880
Sam,enough!I'm not gonna have this conversation!

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.250
Why,because you said so?

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.430
Yes,because I said so!

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.200
Well,you're not dad!

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.500
No,but I am the oldest.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.950
And I'm doing what's best.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.960
You got to let this go.You understand me?

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.370
Tell me about the psychotic killer.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.510
Come on,sam,tell me about the psychotic killer.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.810
"The psychotic killer rips victims apart with brute-like ferocity.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.210
" Okay,any mention of his razor-sharp teeth or his 4-inch claws,animal eyes?

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.880
No.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.410
The lunar cycle's right.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.770
Look,if it is a werewolf,we don't have long.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.870
Moon's full this friday,and that's the last time it changes for a month.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.530
Two days.No sweat.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.330
I'm detective plant.This is detective page.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.290
We're with the county sheriff's department.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.400
Yeah,I've been expecting you.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.610
All morning.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.940
You are the sketch artts,right?

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.570
absolutely.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.430
That is exactly who my partner is.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.450
The things he can do with a pen.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.430
But listen,before we get started on that,I wanted to ask you -- how'd you get away?

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.130
I-I have no idea.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.690
I was hiding,and he found me.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.520
He was coming right for me,and then he just stopped.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.810
Stared at me with this blank look.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.330
After that,he just took off running.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.650
Okay.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.040
Um,I'm gonna need as much physical detail as you can remember.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.670
he was about 6' tall...

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.120
Dark hair.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.270
Um,what about his eyes?What color eyes did he have?

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.840
Maybe...

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.040
blue?

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.500
It was dark.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.530
Did they seem,uh,animal-ish?

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.840
Excuse me?

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.370
What about his teeth?You notice anything strange about them?

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.300
No,they were just teeth.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.300
Teeth.Okay.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.120
How about his fingernails?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.820
Okay,look,he's -- he's just a normal guy with normal eyes and teeth and fingernails.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.850
Look,sir,it's okay -- no.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.640
No.Those were my brothers.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.740
This guy...

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.680
he killed my brothers.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.220
How would you feel?

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.470
Can't imagine anything worse.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.530
I know this isn't easy,but if you could remember any more details...

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.060
there was one more thing.He had a --

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.310
a tattoo on his arm of a cartoon character.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.660
Uh,ugh,it's the guy who -- he's chasing the roadrunner.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.450
Wile E.Coyote.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.510
Yeah,that's it.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.820
Kyle?

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.030
Dr.Garrison.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.080
How you holding up?

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.520
Okay,considering...

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.130
you're,uh,kyle's doctor?

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.500
Yes.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.200
Can I just ask you a few questions?

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.870
Sure.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.300
Don't I get to see it?

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.060
Um,yeah,it's a,you know,work in progress.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.350
It's really...

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.940
Boy,this is a piece of art,really.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.900
Yeah,like you could have done any better.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.420
So,what did the doc have to say about kyle's brothers?

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.200
Not much.They were D.O.A.At the scene.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.130
He did give me the lowdown on the coroner's report.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.060
Their hearts were missing.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.920
Nope,but chunks of their kidneys,lungs,and intestines.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.130
That's just gross.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.390
Yeah,alefinitely not werewolf behavior.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.610
So,what -- demon?

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:13.820
Attacker could have been possessed.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.780
Why would a demon stop halfway through an attack?

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.130
I think that,uh,could've -- yeah,I got nothing.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.780
Me,neither.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.510
Okay,I am starving.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.210
Wait,where are all the powerbars?

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.550
You ate them all.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.920
And we're lost.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.200
We're not lost.The path is right here.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.200
Look.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.960
There.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.560
Civilization.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.370
Thank god.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.680
Are you two doing okay?

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.970
Hi,actually we're -- lost.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.290
Oh,it happens.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.660
The trail gets twisty,and my house is the only one left up here.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.480
I could point you in the right direction,but I'm afraid it'll take a while to get back.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.240
You're really deep into the woods.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.710
Nice work,ken.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.290
Would you like to come in and rest a bit?

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.600
Thanks,but we should head back.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.010
Come on,honey.She offered.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.590
She's a harmless old lady.What could happen?

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.580
You sure you don't want more?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.110
No,thank you.It's,uh...

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.950
I'm full.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.870
We should go.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.500
We really can't thank you enough.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.270
What's going on?

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.080
Are we -- did she drug us?

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.890
Stop.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.750
Please,you have to stop.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.820
Don't worry.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.890
Everything's fine.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.390
You just hold still now,dear.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.170
Stop it!

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.200
Stop!

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.830
Why are you doing this to us?

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.370
ComPlease.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.650
We need to observe you while the drugs still may be in your system.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.360
I have things to do,arrangements I need to make.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.090
It can wait.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.960
Now,you need to rest.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.450
Stay,please.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.580
I'll be back in a few minutes.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.220
Detectives.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.960
Dr.Garrison.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.650
What the hell's going on here?

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.010
My whole town's going insane.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.680
We'll let you know as soon as we do.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.180
Miss watson?

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.070
Need to ask you a few questions.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.400
Do we have to go over this again?

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.640
Now?

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.450
We'll try to be brief.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.880
Miss watson,can you tell us how you got away?

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:55.620
I didn't eat as much as ken did,so I wasn't as out of it.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.870
And when the old woman was...

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.970
carving up ken,I shoved her.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.710
And she fell,cracked her head on the stove.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.760
She's dead,right?

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.070
I-I killed her?

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.020
Do you have any idea why she did this to you?

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.560
No.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:27.450
One minute,she's just a sweet old lady,and the next,she was like a monster.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.640
Can you remember anything else?

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.480
Did you find a little girl there,by any chance?

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.150
A little girl?

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.790
At the house?

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.490
I thought I saw her outside the window.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.360
S-she just disappeared...

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.820
just vanished into thin air.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.740
It must have been the drugs.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.060
This disappearing girl,what did she look like?

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.320
Does it matter?

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.750
Yes,every detail matters.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:13.070
She had this dark,dark hair and really pale skin.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.240
She was around 8.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.530
She was a beautiful child.It was...

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:23.080
odd to see her in the middle of something so horrible.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.500
Well,there's no sulfur anywhere.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.120
How about the emf?

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.370
Yeah,it's going nuts when I went over here by the window.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.060
There was definitely a spirit here.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.560
Who stood outside the crime scene and watched?

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.800
Looks like.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.960
What the hell do you make of that?

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.400
Actually,I do have a theory.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.990
Uh,sort of.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.870
Hit me.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.480
Well,thinking about fairy tales.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.350
Oh,that's -- that's nice.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.970
You think about fairy tales often?

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.850
No,dean,I'm talking about the murders.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.040
A guy and a girl hiking through the woods.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.610
An old lady tries to eat them.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.960
That's "hansel and gretel.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.320
" Then we got the three brothers arguing over how to build houses attacked by the big bad wolf.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.160
"Three little pigs.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.310
Actually,those guys were a little chubby.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.240
Well,wait,I thought all those things ended with everybody living happily ever after.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.600
No,no.Not the originals.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:26.450
See,the grimm brothers' stuff was kind of like the folklore of its day -- full of sex,violence,cannibalism.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:31.780
Then it got sanitized over the years,turned into disney flicks and bedtime stories.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.190
So,you think the murders are,what,a re-enactment?

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.280
It's a little crazy.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.410
As crazy as what?

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.060
Every day of our lives?

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.640
Touch?

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.430
How's the creepy ghost girl involved?

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.960
Um,she must have been here for a reason.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.460
I'm willing to bet you top dollar she was at the construction site,too.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.180
We got to do research now,don't we?

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.590
-So? -Checked every record they had.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.380
Found the usual amount of violent childhood deaths for a town this size.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.810
Do you want to know how many were little girls with black hair and pale skin?

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.520
Zero.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.720
Do you want to know how many little girls with black hair and pale skin have gone missing?

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.930
Right again.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.170
Zip,zilch,nada.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.250
Tell me you got something good,'cause I've totally wasted the last six hours.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.830
Well,you ever hear of lilian bailey?

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.590
She was a british medium from the 1930s.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.150
She got a thing for fairy tales?

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.490
No,trances.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.360
See,she'd go into these unconscious states where,um --

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:36.270
get this -- her thoughts and actions were completely controlled by spirits.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.190
A ghost puppet master?

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.730
You think that's what this kid is doing?

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.320
Sending wolf boy and grandma into trances and making them go kill-crazy?

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.110
Could be.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.000
You know,kind of like a spirit hypnosis or something.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.550
Trances I get,but fairy-tale trances?

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.370
That's bizarre,even for us.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.850
you're right.That's completely normal.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.740
All right,maybe it is fairy tales

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.960
-- totally messed-up fairy tales.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.710
I'll tell you one thing.There's no way I'm kissing a damn frog.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.430
Hey,check that out.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.640
Yeah,it's close to halloween.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.030
You remember cinderella?

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:28.320
The pumpkin that turns into a coach and the mice that become horses.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.920
Dude,could you be more gay?

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.380
Don't answer that.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.710
Oh,who knows?Maybe you'll find your fairy godmother.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:19.870
Help!I'm in here!

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.280
It's okay.We're here.We got you.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.400
You have to help me.She's a lunatic. -what happened

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.500
My stepmom -- she just freaked out,screamed at me,beat me,chained me up.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.440
Where is she now? -idont know

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.300
Sam.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.040
Who are you?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.910
Paramedics picked up cinderella.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.200
That's good.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.030
So,little girl,shiny red apple.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.070
That means something to you,fairy-tale boy?

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.710
I think it's snow white.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.240
"Snow white"?Oh,I saw that movie.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.820
Oh,the porn version,anyways.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.980
There was this wicked stepmother -- she was wicked.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.580
There is a wicked stepmother,and she tries to kill snow white with a poison apple.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.600
But the apple doesn't actually kill the girl,right?

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.680
No.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.360
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.370
No,sorry.We don't have any comatose little girls.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.140
You sure? -Totally.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.440
It's mostly old guys,and,well,callie.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.210
She's been around since before I started here.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.450
Callie?

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.780
It's so sad.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.130
Poor dr.Garrison -- he won't give up on her.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.480
Was callie one of his patients?

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.510
No,his daughter.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.620
Dr.Here we are.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.360
Just press the latch,' called out the grandmother.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.570
I'm too weak to get up.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.610
The wolf pressed the latch,and the door opened.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:09.320
"He stepped inside,went straight to the grandmother,and ate her up.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.000
Thank you so much.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.610
The huntsman stepped inside,and in the bed lay the wolf.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:55.410
"So,the huntsman took a pair of scissors and cut open the wolf's belly.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.960
Detectives,can I help you?

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.520
We just heard that callie is your daughter.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.180
And we wanted to say how very sorry we are.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.160
Well,uh,thank you.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.950
If you'll excuse me...

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.560
oh,we're heading this way.We'll walk with you.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.420
How long has callie been like that?

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.740
W-we don't mean to intrude.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.690
We can't possibly understand how hard it must be for you seeing her like this.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.650
Yeah,it's not easy.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:37.310
She's uh,been here since she was 8 years old.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.710
That's when she was poisoned?

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.300
Yeah,swallowed bleach.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.350
Never figured out how she got her hands on te.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.570
Ottl my wife found her,brought her to the E.R.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.100
Here,and I was on call.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.940
Your wife was,uh -- was that callie's stepmother?

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.360
Actually,yes.How'd you know that?

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.280
Lucky guess.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.230
Well,julie was the only mother that callie ever knew.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.080
My wife passed away last year,and,uh

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.310
,it's just my daughter and me now.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.130
She's all I got left.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.040
Um,excuse me.I've got to get back to work.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.290
Well,you're right.It's snow white in spades.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.450
Stepmom poisons the girl,puts her into a deep sleep.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.130
What's the motive,you think?

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.180
It could be like mischa barton.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.370
"Sixth sense," not "the O.C.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:39.660
" What?!

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.550
Hey,you know fairy tales.I know movies.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.290
She played the pasty ghost.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:49.130
Remember the mom had that thing,you know,where you keep the kid sick so you get all the attention?

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.360
Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.470
Huh,could be.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.260
So,say,all these years callie's been suffering silently

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.640
because nobody knows the truth about what mommy dearest did.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:02.350
And after all this time,her spirit just gets angrier until it finally just starts lashing out.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:07.780
Meanwhile,she has to listen to dad tell her deranged stories about a rabid wolf or a cannibalistic old lady.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.140
It's enough to drive anybody nuts.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.310
Okay,but how are we gonna stop her?

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.410
Callie is stuck here.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.090
Her father's keeping her body alive.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.350
That does make it hard to burn the bone you think?

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.220
Hey,what's the status?

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.550
72-year-old female sustained multiple lacerations and puncture wounds.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:31.470
B.P.Is 80 over 40 and falling.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.050
Sinus tachycardia.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.400
Is that a bite?

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.210
Look like she was mauled by a mad dog or maybe a wolf.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.890
What was the last story dr.Garrison was reading callie?

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.940
"Little red riding hood.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.440
" Excuse me.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.940
Was she the only victim?

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.520
She was found by the side of the road,barely alive.alone

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.680
We need to find her next of kin.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.260
She has a granddaughter.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:04.080
Do you have an address?

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.680
Thank you.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.960
Thanks.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.930
You find a way to stop callie,all right?

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.970
What about you?

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.880
I'm gonna go stop the big bad wolf...

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.950
which is the weirdest thing I've ever said.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.900
Hey,grandma.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.980
Dr.Garrison,

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.300
I need to speak with you.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.260
Detective,what can I do for you?

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.030
Well,um,it's about callie.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.470
My daughter?What about her?

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.560
You know,maybe -- maybe could we sit down for a minute?

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.210
No.What about her?

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.460
Okay,well,um...

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.800
all right,doctor,this isn't gonna be easy.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.910
What happened to callie was not an accident.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:35.970
Excuse me?

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.250
I'm sorry,but it's true.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.190
You have no idea what happened to my daughter.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.180
There are things you don't know,doctor,about your wife.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.490
My wife?

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.620
Doctor,your wife poisoned callie.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.780
Why would you say something so horrible to me?

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.580
Because I need your help.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.660
You stay away from me and from my daughter.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.230
You understand?

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:06.270
Doctor,this is -- please --

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.320
I'm calling security.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.210
No,listen -- I don't have time to do this gently.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:22.070
If you don't listen to me,more people are gonna get hurt because callie is going to hurt them.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:23.580
What the hell are you talking about?

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.970
You're gonna think I'm crazy,but just understand me.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.950
Your daughter,callie,is still here.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.840
She's a spirit.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.330
So,you've seen her,too?

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.020
Are you okay?

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.280
I sensed her...

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.940
callie.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.810
Her presence,her scent.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:44.760
I even saw her standing at the foot of my bed,but I never

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.430
believed it.I thought I was dreaming.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.310
It wasn't a dream.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.790
She looks like she did when she was 8.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.650
White dress,red ribbon in her hair.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.550
She's been trying to talk to you.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:01.390
You're not a cop,are you?

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:02.470
No.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:03.690
Then who are you?

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.950
Someone who knows a little bit about this kind of thing.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.070
Well,what you said about my wife poisoning callie,that --

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:11.090
sir,callie told us.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.050
What?

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:13.470
Not in so many words.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.540
But in her own way,she told us.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:18.920
My wife loved callie!

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.300
So,how's that possible?

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.120
I don't know,but it is.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.330
No,no.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:24.510
I don't believe you.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.040
Look,callie is killing people.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.290
She's angry.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.690
She's desperate because nobody will listen to her.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.350
So you have to listen to her.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.900
Please...

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.160
listen to your daughter.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.590
Garrison: Callie?

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.400
Callie,it's daddy.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.490
It's me,daddy.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.660
Is it true?

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.760
Mommy do that to ?

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.860
I-I know I wasn't listening before,but I'm listening now.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.140
Daddy's here.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:26.140
Please,honey,is -- is there any way that you can tell me?

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.750
Doctor.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.520
Is it true?

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.530
Oh,I'm so sorry,baby.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.960
But listen to me.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.280
You got to stop what you're doing,okay?

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.700
You're hurting people.

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.610
I know everything now.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.110
I know the truth.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:31.660
It's time for you to let go.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.370
It's time for me to let you go.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:13.460
Stop!

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.590
Where -- where am I?

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.340
What?

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.480
r and the girl's okay?

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.340
So...

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.150
it's really over.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.410
All thanks to you.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:02.510
Callie was the most important thing in my life,

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.540
but I should have let her go a long time ago.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.440
See you around,doc.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.180
I sure hope not.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.950
You know what he said.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.470
Some good advice.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.050
Is that what you want me to do,dean?

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:29.680
Just let you go?

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.960
Well,little sammy winchester.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.740
I'm touched.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.660
I mean,your brother's been to see me twice,but you...

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.740
I never had the pleasure.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.550
What can I do for you,sam?

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.260
You can beg for your life.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.520
We were having such a nice conversation.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.360
Then you had to go and ruin the mood.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.750
If I were you,I'd drop the wisecracks and start acting scared.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.050
It's not my style.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.420
That's not the original colt.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.400
Where did you get that?

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.840
Ruby.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:18.540
Had to be.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.340
She is such a pain in my ass.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.560
She'll get what's coming to her.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:25.450
You can count on it.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:26.640
That's enough.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.170
I came here to make you an offer.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.220
You're gonna make me an offer?

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:32.370
That's adorable.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:34.890
You can let dean out of his deal right now.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:38.200
He lives,I live,you live.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.230
Everyone goes home happy.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.990
Or...

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.720
You stop breathing.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.410
Permanently.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.730
All this tough talk.

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.980
I got to tell you,it's not very convincing.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.420
I mean,come on,sam.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.490
Do you even want to break the deal?

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.210
What do you think?

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.460
I don't know.

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:18.950
Aren't you tired of cleaning up dean's messes,of dealing with that broken psyche of his?

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:22.830
Aren't you tired of being bossed around like a snot-nosed little brother?

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:24.570
You're stronger than dean.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.760
You're better than him.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:26.850
Watch your mouth.

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:33.430
Admit it -- you're here,going through the motions,but truth is,you'll be a tiny bit relieved when he's gone.

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:38.290
Shut up. -No more desperate,sloppy,needy dean.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:41.710
You can finally be free.

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.450
I said,"shut up.

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.840
Doth protest too much,if you ask me.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.640
All right,I've had enough of your crap.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.640
You let dean out of his deal right now.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:58.310
Sorry,sweetheart,but your brother's an adult.

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:02.850
He made that deal of his own free will,fair and square.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:04.690
It's ironclad.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.430
Every deal can be broken.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.930
Not this one.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.200
Fine.Then I'll kill you.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.910
If you're gone,so is the deal.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.230
Guess again.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:16.960
What?

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.650
Sam,I'm just a saleswoman.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.390
I got a boss,like everybody.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:24.020
He holds the contract,not me.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.210
He wants dean's soul bad.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.560
And believe me,he's not gonna let it go.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:29.690
You're bluffing.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.660
Am I?

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.670
Shoot me,if it will get you off,but the deal still holds.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.650
And when dean's time is up,he's getting dragged into the pit.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.230
And who's your boss?

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.600
Who holds the contract?

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:44.120
He's not as cuddly as me,I can tell you that.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.630
Who is it?

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.920
I can't tell you.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:54.210
I'm sorry,sam,but there's no way out of this one

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.460
-- not this time.
