I know how you feel,Dean.


00:15.100 --> 00:15.740
Dad's dead.


00:16.080 --> 00:18.640
He left a hole and it hurts
so bad that you can't take it.

I'm ok. I swear to the next person who ask
me if I'm ok,I am start to throw punches.

You are gonna die. And this

00:33.910 --> 00:36.590
I'm just a saleswoman. I

00:37.750 --> 00:39.150

Lind


01:46.510 --> 01:47.420
I had to talk to you.


01:48.090 --> 01:49.220
You can't keep calling here.


01:49.170 --> 01:50.620
Ow,I know.


01:50.620 --> 01:52.820
Just tell me you
thought about it,please.


01:52.930 --> 01:53.810
There's nothing to think about.


01:54.420 --> 01:55.060
Don't say that.


01:56.210 --> 01:59.030
I can't. You know
I can't -- My wife.

We can be together.
We can be happy.


02:28.340 --> 02:30.710

You know I do.

02:44.060 --> 02:44.570
But...


02:46.140 --> 02:47.040
I'm sorry.


02:47.950 --> 02:48.460
Ben,wait.


03:41.170 --> 03:41.990
Okay,linda.

Yep. I got it. Okay,bye.


04:10.850 --> 04:11.300
So?


04:12.430 --> 04:14.430
So,the professor doesn't know crap.


04:14.720 --> 04:16.860
Shocking. Pack your panties,Sammy.
We're hitting the road.


04:17.210 --> 04:18.010
What? What's up?


04:18.240 --> 04:19.240
That was bobby.


04:19.460 --> 04:22.070
Some banker guy blew
his head off in ohio,


04:22.220 --> 04:23.170
And he thinks there's
a spirit involved.


04:23.900 --> 04:25.080
So you two were talking a case?


04:25.290 --> 04:27.370
No,we were actually
talking about our feelings


04:28.120 --> 04:29.160
And then our favorite boy bands.


04:29.540 --> 04:30.420
Yeah,we were talking a case.


04:30.730 --> 04:31.450
So,a spirit
-- What?


04:31.940 --> 04:33.020
Yeah,well,banker was complaining


04:33.370 --> 04:35.450
About some electrical problems
at his pad for,like,a week --


04:36.330 --> 04:38.410
Phones going haywire,
computers flipping on and off.


04:38.780 --> 04:39.190
Huh?


04:40.700 --> 04:41.020
Uh-Huh.


04:41.370 --> 04:42.310
This is not ringing your bell?


04:43.270 --> 04:46.430
Well,sure,yeah,but,Dean,we're
on a case.


04:47.240 --> 04:48.720
Whose? Yours.


04:49.310 --> 04:51.530
Right,yeah. Could have fooled me.


04:51.810 --> 04:52.920
What the hell else
have we ha doing lately


04:53.320 --> 04:54.410
Other than trying
to break your deal?


04:54.600 --> 04:55.880
Chasing our tails,that's what.


04:57.950 --> 04:59.920
Sam,we've talked to
every professor,witch,


05:00.080 --> 05:02.430
Soothsayer,and two-Bit
carny act in the lower 48.


05:02.670 --> 05:03.470
Nobody knows squat.


05:04.850 --> 05:06.740
And we can't find bela.
We can't find the colt.


05:07.050 --> 05:08.320
So until we actually
find something,


05:09.180 --> 05:09.950
I'd like to do my job.


05:11.030 --> 05:13.260
Well,there's one thing we
haven't tried yet. No,Sam. No.


05:13.460 --> 05:15.490
Dean,we should summon ruby. I'm
not gonna have this fight with you.


05:15.600 --> 05:17.090
She says she knows how to
save you! Well,she can't!


05:17.250 --> 05:18.580
Oh,really? You know
that for sure? I do.


05:18.740 --> 05:20.190
How? Because she told me,okay?


05:23.770 --> 05:24.210
What?


05:24.210 --> 05:25.620
She told me...


05:26.370 --> 05:27.320
flat-Out


05:27.320 --> 05:29.410
that she could not
save me -- Nobody can.


05:33.950 --> 05:36.170
And you just somehow neglected
to mention this to me?


05:36.570 --> 05:38.190
Well,you know,I really don't
care what that bitch thinks,


05:38.280 --> 05:38.900
And neither should you,so...


05:39.350 --> 05:40.360
so what -- Now you're
keeping secretfrom me,Dean?


05:40.540 --> 05:42.520
You really want to wk about
who's keeping secrets from who?


05:49.710 --> 05:50.380
Now where are you going?


05:51.210 --> 05:52.200
Guess I'm going to ohig


06:07.050 --> 06:09.390
I found him...there.


06:10.800 --> 06:12.930
Why don't you just tell us
everything you saw,mrs. Waters?


06:14.400 --> 06:15.930
You mean besides my dead husband?


06:16.160 --> 06:19.410
Well,just everything
else...you saw,please.


06:22.590 --> 06:25.640
There was,uh,blood...everywhere.


06:27.010 --> 06:28.520
The phone was ripped from the wall,


06:28.790 --> 06:30.020
His favorite scotch on the desk.


06:30.210 --> 06:31.460
What else could yoco
possibly want to know?


06:31.610 --> 06:32.950
Why was the phone
ripped from the wall?


06:33.320 --> 06:33.980
I don't know.


06:34.390 --> 06:35.290
You mind if I take a look?


06:38.300 --> 06:40.540
I already went over all this
with the other detectives.


06:40.670 --> 06:42.090
We'll be out of your
hair in no time nma'am.


06:48.170 --> 06:49.790
Ma'am,what time did
your husband die?


06:50.670 --> 06:51.850
Sometime after 11:00.


06:58.220 --> 06:59.290
What about strange phone cas?


07:00.360 --> 07:01.240

those lately --


07:01.690 --> 07:03.320
Weird interference,static,
anything like that?


07:03.710 --> 07:04.200
No.


07:06.140 --> 07:06.550
No.


07:08.250 --> 07:10.270
Mrs. Waters,withholding
information from the police


07:10.700 --> 07:12.580
Is a capital off


07:16.110 --> 07:17.220
In some parts he world,I'm sure.


07:21.190 --> 07:24.290
A couple of weeks
ago,um,there was this...


07:24.830 --> 07:25.380
this what?


07:27.220 --> 07:29.760
I woke up one morning,
i heard Ben in his study.


07:30.480 --> 07:31.730
I thought he was
talking to a woman.


07:32.100 --> 07:32.820
What made you think that?


07:32.950 --> 07:34.260
Because he kept calling her linda.


07:35.550 --> 07:36.160
The thing is...


07:37.840 --> 07:38.950
i picked up the other line,


07:39.230 --> 07:41.410
And...nobody was there.


07:41.570 --> 07:43.350
Ben was talking to
nobody. There was nothing?


07:44.360 --> 07:45.250
Just static.


07:47.480 --> 07:49.060
Did you ever speak to
Ben about this phone call?


07:49.190 --> 07:51.080
No. I should have,but,no.


07:51.260 --> 07:52.410
Did he ever say who linda was?


07:52.520 --> 07:53.780
What difference does it make?!


07:53.910 --> 07:55.340
There was no one on the other end!


08:01.600 --> 08:02.750
Linda's a babe...


08:03.350 --> 08:04.020
or was.


08:04.720 --> 08:05.210
Find her?


08:05.330 --> 08:06.310
Yeah,linda bateman.


08:06.860 --> 08:08.750

08:08.750 --> 08:12.380
So what happened? Drunk
driver hit Ben walked away.


08:12.460 --> 08:15.180
So,what -- Dead
flame calls to chat?


08:15.430 --> 08:17.790
You would think,but
linda was cremated.


08:18.680 --> 08:19.870
So why is she still
floating around?


08:22.220 --> 08:23.430
Uh,you got me.


08:24.090 --> 08:25.570
What about that,uh,caller i.D.?


08:25.680 --> 08:27.040
Turns out it's a phone number.


08:27.500 --> 08:28.640
It's no phone number ever seen.


08:29.010 --> 08:30.350
Yeah,because it's
about a century old


08:30.720 --> 08:32.000
From back when phones sd cranks.


08:32.170 --> 08:33.990
***


08:34.060 --> 08:35.270
You got me there,too,


08:35.270 --> 08:36.600
But either way,we
should run a trace on it.


08:36.760 --> 08:38.720
Well,how the hell are we gonna trace
a number that's over 100 years old?


08:39.250 --> 08:41.710
We don't get too many
folks from h.Q. Down here.


08:41.750 --> 08:43.100
Yes,well,office mentioned


08:43.100 --> 08:44.060

08:45.460 --> 08:46.980
Well,I'm sure we can
arrange something.


08:47.300 --> 08:49.360
The man you gentlemen want to
be speaking to is right this --


08:51.760 --> 08:52.550
I know. Sorry.


08:53.170 --> 08:56.360
Got something of a hygiene
issue down here,if you ask me.


08:59.520 --> 09:00.040
Stewie?


09:01.800 --> 09:03.890
What did I tell you about
keeping this place clean?


09:04.360 --> 09:06.020
Spam mail. Spam mail.


09:06.650 --> 09:08.900

09:08.900 --> 09:10.590
I don't know how all this got here.


09:11.850 --> 09:13.320

09:14.280 --> 09:14.950
Oh.


09:15.770 --> 09:17.100
Give these gentlemen
whatever they need.

Thank you. Thanks.


09:21.280 --> 09:22.410
So,can I help you?


09:24.690 --> 09:26.270
Is that,uh,bustyasianbeauties.Com?


09:26.460 --> 09:26.880
No.


09:29.520 --> 09:29.890
Maybe.


09:30.180 --> 09:33.360
Word to the wise -- Platinum
membership worth every penny.


09:33.680 --> 09:35.830
Right. Anyway,um,we're
here to trace a number.


09:37.760 --> 09:38.310
Where did you get this?


09:38.660 --> 09:40.580
Off caller i.D. Oh,no.
That's impossible.


09:40.790 --> 09:42.240
Hasn't been used in
a few years. We know.


09:42.590 --> 09:44.720
"A few years." It's
prehistoric. Trust me.


09:44.870 --> 09:45.930
Nobody's using this number anymore.


09:46.160 --> 09:47.700
Sure. Could you run it anyways?


09:47.920 --> 09:50.600
Sure. Why don't I just
rearrange my whole life first?


09:52.680 --> 09:54.170
Listen,uh,stewie.


09:55.240 --> 09:56.260
You got like six kinds


09:56.400 --> 09:58.220
Of employee-Code
violations down here,


09:58.360 --> 10:00.010
Not to mention the sickening porn


10:00.400 --> 10:01.650
Clogging up your hard drive.


10:02.980 --> 10:04.530
When my partner
says run the number,


10:05.000 --> 10:06.530
I suggest you run the number.


10:23.040 --> 10:24.230
Holy crap. What?


10:25.080 --> 10:26.610
I can't tell you where
the number comes from.


10:28.460 --> 10:30.090
But I can tell you
where it's been going.


10:31.900 --> 10:32.460
What do you mean?


10:35.850 --> 10:37.610
10 different houses
in the past two weeks


10:38.540 --> 10:40.120
All got calls from the Same number.


10:50.590 --> 10:52.330
So,are we,e here?


10:53.080 --> 10:54.860

Yeah.


11:27.120 --> 11:29.070
Hello,sir. I'm with
the phone cpany.


11:29.580 --> 11:31.730
Uh,we didn't call
the phone company.


11:31.920 --> 11:33.660
Oh,no,sir. No,see,we're

11:33.900 --> 11:36.930
We've had a lot of complaints from

11:36.930 --> 11:39.600
Yes,sir,uh,droppecalls,static,s


11:40.170 --> 11:42.820
Maybe even strange voices
on the other end of thne?


11:43.040 --> 11:44.530
No,we haven't had any of that here.


11:45.260 --> 11:46.800
Nothing? No.


11:47.050 --> 11:50.100
Okay,uh,great. Just
thought we'd check. Thanks.


11:50.360 --> 11:50.820
No problem.


11:51.570 --> 11:52.170
Let's go.


12:08.120 --> 12:09.370
No way you work for
the phone company.


12:12.140 --> 12:12.700
Sure,I do.


12:12.830 --> 12:14.800
Since when does a
phone guy drive a rental


12:15.110 --> 12:16.540
Or wear a cheap suit?


12:20.620 --> 12:24.270
Yeah? Well,maybe
we're both keg secrets.


12:27.230 --> 12:29.520
D you ask my dad if we heard
strange voices on the phone?


12:29.680 --> 12:31.270
Why? Did you hear something? No.


12:31.270 --> 12:32.620
My mistake. Thought maybe you did.


12:32.870 --> 12:34.040
Well,I didn't,okay?


12:35.210 --> 12:36.970
Okay. Sorry to bother you.


12:44.570 --> 12:45.450
Because,you know...


12:47.550 --> 12:48.220
if you did,


12:50.000 --> 12:51.930
Then I would have
told you that I've been


12:52.150 --> 12:53.530
Right where you're
standing right now.


12:55.770 --> 12:56.530
Hearing things,


12:57.580 --> 12:59.690
Even seeing things that
couldn't be explained.


13:01.850 --> 13:04.220
Maybe I would have been able
to help out a little bit.


13:07.700 --> 13:08.400
Yways...


13:11.070 --> 13:11.710
wait.


13:14.460 --> 13:15.010
Maybe...


13:18.160 --> 13:20.160
...maybe I've been
talking on the phone...


13:20.970 --> 13:21.570
th

She's dead...


13:29.260 --> 13:31.040

13:31.600 --> 13:33.600
How often does she call you?


13:33.900 --> 13:35.900
A few times.


13:35.900 --> 13:38.300
It started a week ago.


13:38.800 --> 13:41.800
I thought I was,like,crazy
or something.


13:42.900 --> 13:44.700
Well,I can tell you
one thing for sure,


13:44.700 --> 13:47.700
And you're gonna have to
go with me on this,okay?


13:48.000 --> 13:50.600
You're not crazy.


13:54.500 --> 13:56.400
Dude,stiffs are calling
people all over town.


13:56.400 --> 13:57.600
Tell me about it


13:57.600 --> 14:00.600
I just talked to an enghty years gradmother
Who's having phone sex with her husband...


14:00.700 --> 14:02.400
- who died in korea.
- Ugh.


14:02.400 --> 14:06.000
Completely rocked my understanding
Of the word "necrophilia."


14:06.000 --> 14:08.400
So,what the hell's
going on here,Dean?


14:08.400 --> 14:10.100
Beats me,but we
better find out soon.


14:10.100 --> 14:11.900
This place is turning
into spook central.


14:11.900 --> 14:13.800
Yeah. All right,I'll
call you later.


14:13.800 --> 14:15.600
Yep.


14:18.400 --> 14:21.200
Yeah,what?


14:21.200 --> 14:22.100
Sam?


14:22.100 --> 14:24.100
Dean.


14:25.700 --> 14:27.900
Dean,is that you?


14:27.900 --> 14:29.900
Dad?


14:31.700 --> 14:33.700
I mean Dad?


14:34.800 --> 14:36.900
You really think it was dad?


14:36.900 --> 14:39.700
I don't know. Maybe.


14:39.700 --> 14:42.800
Well,what did he sound like?


14:42.800 --> 14:44.700
Like oprah. It was dad.


14:44.700 --> 14:46.000
He sounded like dad.
What do you think?


14:46.100 --> 14:47.400
What did he say?


14:47.900 --> 14:49.100
My name.


14:49.100 --> 14:50.400
That's it?


14:50.500 --> 14:53.000
Yeah,the call dropped out.


14:55.600 --> 14:57.600
Why would not he call
in the first place,Dean?


14:57.600 --> 15:00.500
I don't know,man. Why are ghosts
calling anybody in this town?


15:01.600 --> 15:03.600
But I mean,other people are
hearing from their loved ones.


15:03.600 --> 15:06.000
Why can't we? It's at
least a possibility,right?


15:09.200 --> 15:10.400
Yeah,I guess.


15:13.000 --> 15:14.600
Okay,so what...


15:18.000 --> 15:20.300
what if it really is dad?


15:21.100 --> 15:23.100
What happens if he calls back?


15:23.300 --> 15:24.700
What do you mean?


15:26.100 --> 15:27.400
What do I say?


15:28.500 --> 15:29.500
"Hello"?


15:29.600 --> 15:30.700
"Hello"?


15:31.500 --> 15:33.600
What you come back
with -- "Hello"?


15:39.800 --> 15:41.200
"hello"


15:54.500 --> 15:55.800
Find anything?


15:56.300 --> 15:59.800
After three hours,i
have found no reason


15:59.800 --> 16:02.900
Why anything supernatural
would be going on here.


16:03.100 --> 16:05.000
Wow,you know,you'd think
a stanford education


16:05.000 --> 16:06.700
And a high-School
hookup rate of 0.0


16:06.900 --> 16:08.600
Would produce better
results than that.


16:08.700 --> 16:09.900
Hilarious.


16:09.900 --> 16:12.000
Sam,you're just looking
in the wrong places,pal.


16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
And what are the right places,Dean?


16:15.300 --> 16:17.700
Motel pamphlet rack.


16:17.700 --> 16:20.100
Milan,ohio -- Birthplace
of thomas edison.


16:20.300 --> 16:21.900
Yeah,right. So what?


16:21.900 --> 16:23.600
Keep reading.


16:31.700 --> 16:33.100
You're kidding.


16:34.000 --> 16:36.200
And we're walking.


16:36.200 --> 16:38.200
And here we have
one of the museum's


16:38.300 --> 16:40.400
Most unique and
treasured possessions --


16:40.400 --> 16:43.200
Thomas edison's "spirit phone."


16:43.300 --> 16:44.900
Did you know that mr. Edison,


16:44.900 --> 16:47.200
While being one of america's
most beloved inventors,


16:47.400 --> 16:49.600
Was also a devout "occultist"?


16:50.100 --> 16:51.100
Ooh-Ooh.


16:51.600 --> 16:52.900
What's with the quotey fingers?


16:52.900 --> 16:55.100
He spent years working on this
- his final invention


16:55.400 --> 16:57.600
Which he was
convinced could be used


16:57.600 --> 16:59.700
To "communicate" with the "dead."


16:59.700 --> 17:01.200
Pretty spooky,huh?


17:01.900 --> 17:05.400
And we're walking. We are walking.


17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
And we are not touching
that. And we are walking.


17:11.300 --> 17:12.900
Anything?


17:12.900 --> 17:14.600
Nothing.


17:16.000 --> 17:17.900
What do you think?


17:18.100 --> 17:19.300
Honestly?


17:19.300 --> 17:21.300
It kind of looks like an
old pile of junk to me.


17:22.700 --> 17:23.800
It's not even plugged in.


17:23.800 --> 17:25.800
- Maybe it doesn't work like that.
- Okay.


17:27.000 --> 17:28.400
Maybe it's like a radio tower,


17:28.400 --> 17:30.300
You know,broadcasting
the dead all over town.


17:30.300 --> 17:31.300
Could be.


17:31.300 --> 17:33.400
Well,you know,the caller
i.D.'S 100 years old,right?


17:33.700 --> 17:34.900
Right around the time
this thing was built.


17:34.900 --> 17:36.700
Yeah,but why would it all
of a sudden ssu working now?


17:36.900 --> 17:38.600
I don't know.


17:38.900 --> 17:41.400
But as long as the moldy are
calling the freshes around here,


17:41.400 --> 17:42.900
It's the best reason we got.


17:43.100 --> 17:44.300
Yeah,maybe.


17:46.000 --> 17:48.200
So maybe it really is dad.


18:05.600 --> 18:06.400
Dad?


18:06.400 --> 18:07.900
Dean.


18:08.000 --> 18:09.300
Is it really you?


18:09.300 --> 18:12.100
It's me.


18:12.700 --> 18:13.500
How can I be sure?


18:13.500 --> 18:15.200
You can't.


18:15.400 --> 18:17.600
Dean,how could you do it?


18:17.600 --> 18:19.200
Do what?


18:19.200 --> 18:20.900
Sell your soul.


18:21.100 --> 18:22.900
I was looking after
Sammy like you told me to.


18:22.900 --> 18:25.400
I never wanted
this --Never.


18:25.600 --> 18:27.600
You're my boy. I love you.


18:27.800 --> 18:29.500
I can't watch you go to hell,Dean.


18:29.500 --> 18:32.200
I'm sorry. I don't
know how to stop it


18:32.700 --> 18:35.600
Because if you break
the deal,Sam dies,right?


18:35.600 --> 18:35.900
What?


18:35.900 --> 18:38.300
- Well,I know a way out...for both of you.
- How?


18:38.700 --> 18:40.700
The demon who holds
your contract --


18:40.700 --> 18:43.000
He's here...now.


18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
(ok,see you tomorrow)


18:59.100 --> 19:01.200
(Lanie? Is that you?)


19:05.100 --> 19:06.300
(Mom?)


19:12.100 --> 19:15.200
(I asked you a question last
night. Have you thought about it?)


19:20.500 --> 19:23.700
(I don't know what you want Of
course you do. I want to see you)


19:32.500 --> 19:35.100
(I went to see you.
At the cemetery.)


19:39.200 --> 19:41.600
(That's not what I mean.)


19:48.400 --> 19:49.700
(But I am scared.)


19:53.300 --> 19:55.600
(Don't be scared. I am
right here with you.)


20:26.900 --> 20:28.400
(come to me)


20:55.300 --> 20:57.000
What's up?


20:57.000 --> 20:58.700
Girl lanie
--Her mom's ghost


20:59.200 --> 21:00.900
Spooked her out
pretty bad last night.


21:00.900 --> 21:02.600
- That sucks.
- Yeah,it does.


21:02.800 --> 21:03.600
What are you doing?


21:03.600 --> 21:05.400
I think dad's right.


21:05.500 --> 21:08.400
I think the demon is here.


21:08.400 --> 21:09.100
Check it out.


21:14.400 --> 21:15.900
What is this
--Weather reports?


21:15.900 --> 21:17.200
Omens --
Demonic omens --


21:17.500 --> 21:20.500
Electrical storms everywhere
we've beenFor the past two weeks.


21:21.100 --> 21:23.400
I-I don't remember
any lightning storms.


21:23.500 --> 21:26.300
Well,I don't remember you studying
meteorology as a kid,either.


21:26.300 --> 21:27.900
But I'm telling you -- That
bastard's been tailing me,


21:28.500 --> 21:29.700
Wearing some poor dude's meat.


21:32.000 --> 21:34.400
And it's following you because...?


21:35.200 --> 21:36.500
I guess I'm big game,you know?


21:36.500 --> 21:38.100
My ass is too sweet
to let out of sight.


21:39.400 --> 21:41.800
Okay,sure.


21:42.600 --> 21:45.600
Don't get too excited,Sammy.
You might pull something.


21:46.700 --> 21:48.900
Dean,look,I want to believe
this,man. I really do.


21:48.900 --> 21:50.400
Then believe it!


21:50.800 --> 21:53.200
I mean,if we get this
sucker,it's miller time.


21:53.200 --> 21:54.000
Yeah,that's another thing.


21:54.000 --> 21:56.300
Dad rattles off an exorcism
that can kill a demon --


21:56.500 --> 21:58.700
I mean,not just send it
back to hell,but kill it?


21:58.800 --> 22:00.300
I checked it out.


22:00.700 --> 22:03.000
This is heavy-Duty dark ages.


22:03.200 --> 22:05.100
15th century.


22:05.100 --> 22:07.300
Yeah,I checked on it,too,Dean.


22:07.400 --> 22:08.700
And so did bobby.


22:10.900 --> 22:12.700
Okay. and?


22:12.700 --> 22:15.000
Look,it definitely
is an exorcism,okay?


22:15.100 --> 22:17.900
There's just no evidence
that it can kill a demon.


22:18.500 --> 22:20.300
- No evidence it can't.
- Dean,come on.


22:20.300 --> 22:22.000
Hey,as far as I
know,the only one of us


22:22.000 --> 22:24.100
That's actually been
to hell is dad,okay?


22:24.100 --> 22:25.700
Think maybe he picked up a
couple of tricks down there --


22:25.700 --> 22:28.200
- Like which exorcisms work?
- Maybe it does,okay?


22:28.200 --> 22:30.700
- Look,I hope it does,too,but we just got to be sure.
- Why aren't we sure?


22:30.700 --> 22:33.400
Because I don't know what's
going on around here,Dean.


22:33.700 --> 22:35.500
I mean,some guy
blows his brains out,


22:35.800 --> 22:37.800
A little girl is
scared out of her wits.


22:37.800 --> 22:40.300
Wow,man! A couple of civvies
are freaked out by some ghosts.


22:40.300 --> 22:41.500
News
flash,Sam --


22:41.600 --> 22:43.800
People are supposed to
be freaked out by ghosts!


22:49.200 --> 22:50.400
Dad tell you where
to find the demon?


22:50.400 --> 22:51.800
I'm waiting on the call!


22:55.100 --> 22:58.600
I told lanie I'd stop by.


22:58.800 --> 23:00.000
Oh,good,yeah.


23:00.000 --> 23:01.900
No,you go hang out with jailbait.


23:01.900 --> 23:03.700
Just watch out for chris hansen.


23:03.700 --> 23:05.200
Meanwhile,I'll be here,you know,


23:05.200 --> 23:07.500
Getting ready to save my life.


23:11.400 --> 23:13.900
You are unbelievable,you know that?


23:13.900 --> 23:16.500
I mean,for months we've been
trying to break this demon deal.


23:16.700 --> 23:18.400
Now dad's about to give
us the freakin' address,


23:18.400 --> 23:19.800
And you can't accept it?!


23:20.300 --> 23:22.100
The man is dead,and you're
still butting heads with the guy!


23:22.100 --> 23:23.600
- That is not what this is about.
- Then what is it?!


23:23.600 --> 23:26.400
The fact is,we got no
hard proof here,Dean.


23:26.500 --> 23:29.500
After everything,you're still
just going on blind faith!


23:29.600 --> 23:32.300
Yeah,well,maybe! You know,
maybe that's all I got,okay?!


23:37.600 --> 23:39.500
Please.


23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Just please don't go anywhere


23:42.000 --> 23:43.900
Until I get back,okay,Dean?


23:43.900 --> 23:45.600
Please.


24:08.200 --> 24:10.100
Have you told your
father about any of this?


24:10.100 --> 24:12.600
And bother him at work? No.


24:13.500 --> 24:14.600
He wouldn't believe me anyway.


24:14.600 --> 24:15.900
He'd just chuck me into therapy.


24:15.900 --> 24:17.000
So what did your mother say?


24:18.900 --> 24:20.400
That she wanted to see me.


24:20.400 --> 24:23.100
So,at first,I thought I was
supposed to go to the cemetery.


24:23.100 --> 24:25.600
- Did you?
- Nothing happened.


24:28.300 --> 24:31.100
But then she started asking
me to do other things.


24:31.500 --> 24:33.300
What sort of things?


24:34.800 --> 24:36.200
Bad things.


24:55.300 --> 24:59.100
Hello? Simon greenfield speaking.


24:59.100 --> 25:00.600
Hi,mommy.


25:00.600 --> 25:03.300
- Yeah,I want to see you.
- Where are you?


25:12.300 --> 25:12.900
Dad?


25:12.900 --> 25:13.700
Dean.


25:13.700 --> 25:15.100
Where's the demon?


25:15.700 --> 25:18.500
Lanie,please. Tell
me what happened.


25:18.500 --> 25:20.500
It's very important.


25:20.500 --> 25:23.200
Mom told me to go to
dad's medicine cabinet.


25:23.400 --> 25:24.800
And?


25:24.800 --> 25:28.300
Take his sleeping pills --
Take all his sleeping pills!


25:28.400 --> 25:30.800
She wanted you to kill yourself?


25:33.980 --> 25:36.960
Why would my mom
want me to do that?


25:37.290 --> 25:38.910
I don't know.


25:38.940 --> 25:42.920
I mean,just so I could come to her?


25:43.590 --> 25:44.960
What'd you say?


25:44.980 --> 25:46.360
She wanted me to come to her.


25:46.380 --> 25:48.800
No,no,no,no,no. How
did she say it exactly?


25:48.820 --> 25:52.380
"Come to me --"
Like,a million times.


25:55.730 --> 25:58.800
Lanie, that's not your mother.


26:27.150 --> 26:28.080
All right,listen to me.


26:28.130 --> 26:30.150
Don't answer the phone.
Don't use the computer.


26:30.180 --> 26:33.180
Don't do anything unless
i say to,all right?


26:34.130 --> 26:35.380
Lanie.


26:36.340 --> 26:38.030
Where's simon?


26:53.900 --> 26:55.620
Hello?


27:34.090 --> 27:35.850
Dean,it's not dad. What is it?


27:35.880 --> 27:37.500
A crocotta. Is that a sandwich?


27:37.550 --> 27:39.460
Some kind of scavenger
-- Mimics loved ones,


27:39.480 --> 27:40.670
Whispers "come to me,"


27:40.710 --> 27:43.180
and loses you in the dark
and swallows your soul.


27:43.200 --> 27:45.850
Crocotta -- Right.
Damn,that makes sense.


27:45.880 --> 27:47.320
Dean,look. I'm
sorry,man. I know --


27:47.340 --> 27:49.200
Hey,don't these things
live in filth? Yeah.


27:49.230 --> 27:51.710
Sam,the flies at the phone company.


28:31.420 --> 28:34.070
This is herman munster.
Leave a message.


28:34.080 --> 28:37.510
Dean,I'm in the parking
lot. He's here. Hurry.


28:45.510 --> 28:47.040
Whoa,what the hell?!


28:47.070 --> 28:48.090
I know what you are.


28:48.110 --> 28:50.020
Wait,mister,please. And
I know how to kill you.


28:50.050 --> 28:52.390
Okay,wait,wait.


28:52.420 --> 28:55.050
If we're overcharging
you for the call-Waiting


28:55.070 --> 28:56.630
Something, i --
I can fix that.


28:56.650 --> 28:58.880
I'm your friend.


28:58.910 --> 29:01.440
Just -- Just
don't kill me.


29:01.460 --> 29:03.560
Don't kill me,please!


29:07.090 --> 29:08.860
Yeah!


29:08.880 --> 29:09.840
That's what happens


29:09.860 --> 29:13.510
When you mess with the
phone company,dillweed!


29:15.490 --> 29:17.390
Thank you,clark.


29:18.860 --> 29:20.720
Forget about it.


29:21.260 --> 29:22.840
Clark?


29:34.060 --> 29:36.610
I'm -- I'm
sorry,clark.


29:37.160 --> 29:39.710
I'm sorry for
whatever I did to you.


29:38.930 --> 29:40.420
I'm sorry. Please.


29:40.460 --> 29:43.810
Wait! Wait. Don't do it.


29:43.860 --> 29:45.880
You're awake.


29:45.950 --> 29:49.420
You're not a killer,clark. No!


29:49.560 --> 29:53.720
There's a -- There's a good
man inside of you. I know it.


29:53.930 --> 29:56.230
What do you think,Sammy?


29:56.280 --> 29:57.770
Am I a good man?


29:57.810 --> 30:00.350
Just let him go.


30:00.440 --> 30:04.020
I would. I really would.


30:04.260 --> 30:07.140
If only I'd had more
than a salad for lunch.


30:07.190 --> 30:09.020
See...


30:09.260 --> 30:10.390
I'm starving.


30:10.440 --> 30:12.260
No! Ugh!


30:44.860 --> 30:47.630
My last call
with Dean --


30:47.670 --> 30:49.700
It was you.


30:49.750 --> 30:52.070
You led me here.


30:54.170 --> 30:58.770
Some calls I make,
some calls I take.


30:58.800 --> 31:03.820
But you have to admit, i
had you fooled for a while.


31:03.860 --> 31:07.630
All that edison phone crap...


31:07.970 --> 31:10.100
oh,well.


31:13.820 --> 31:15.000
What are you doing?


31:17.970 --> 31:20.770
I'm killing your brother.


31:20.800 --> 31:24.130
Or maybe I'm killing another guy.


31:24.380 --> 31:27.070
We'll just have to see how it goes.


31:40.080 --> 31:41.120
Hello?


31:41.170 --> 31:43.900
Hi,daddy.


31:43.930 --> 31:45.830
Hey,baby.


31:47.870 --> 31:50.290
I thought you said you
weren't gonna call anymore.


31:50.330 --> 31:53.170
I know,daddy.


31:53.450 --> 31:56.010
You know how sad this
makes your old man.


31:58.290 --> 32:00.910
How upset I was at your funeral.


32:00.940 --> 32:05.370
I had to call. I know
who killed me,daddy.


32:05.660 --> 32:07.170
What?


32:07.190 --> 32:10.870
The man who killed me --
He's at the house right now.


32:10.900 --> 32:13.500
What -- What are
you saying to me?


32:13.530 --> 32:17.030
He's at the house,daddy.
He wants to kill you,too.


32:26.540 --> 32:28.870
You know,mimicking
Dean's one thing.


32:28.900 --> 32:31.960
But my dad -- That's
a hell of a trick.


32:31.990 --> 32:35.530
Ll,once I made you two
as hunters,it was easy.


32:38.000 --> 32:42.430
Found Dean's number,
then your number,


32:42.470 --> 32:44.640
Then your father's numbers,


32:44.660 --> 32:50.130
Then to e-Mails,voice
mails -- Everything.


32:50.850 --> 32:54.690
You see,people think that
that stuff just gets erased.


32:54.710 --> 32:56.850
But it doesn't.


32:56.870 --> 32:58.780
You'd be surprised at
how much of yourself


32:58.800 --> 33:01.640
Is just floating out there,


33:01.640 --> 33:04.430
waiting to be plucked.


33:04.470 --> 33:06.970
Dean's not gonna fall for this.


33:07.830 --> 33:10.080
He's not gonna kill that guy.


33:10.110 --> 33:12.500
Then the guy killsuy


34:30.790 --> 34:33.230
Technology...


34:35.950 --> 34:38.670
...makes life so much easier.


34:40.440 --> 34:44.510
It used to be I'd -- I'd
hide in the woods for days,


34:44.600 --> 34:46.280
Weeks,


34:46.280 --> 34:49.230
whispering to people,


34:49.250 --> 34:52.600
Trying to draw them
out into the night.


34:53.210 --> 34:55.980
But they had community.


34:55.000 --> 34:58.530
They all looked out
after each other.


34:58.560 --> 35:02.070
I'd be lucky to eat maybe
one, two souls a year.


35:02.860 --> 35:07.280
But now when I'm hungry,
i simply make a phone call.


35:07.300 --> 35:10.230
You're all so connected...


35:11.330 --> 35:14.440
but you've never been so alone.


35:51.420 --> 35:52.720
What is this?


35:52.750 --> 35:54.840
Your funeral.


35:56.680 --> 35:58.610
???


35:58.650 --> 36:01.170
??


36:01.210 --> 36:02.540
???


36:02.560 --> 36:05.070
Did you do this to my daughter,too?


36:06.400 --> 36:09.070
- How the hell did you get out?
- Did you do this to my daughter,too?!


36:09.100 --> 36:11.380
- Wait.This is a mistake.
- You killed her.


36:11.400 --> 36:13.750
You killed her, you son of a bitch!


36:52.450 --> 36:54.290
She was 9 years old!


36:54.330 --> 36:56.400
Stop! I didn't!


36:56.430 --> 36:58.100
You got to believe me!


37:05.290 --> 37:07.750
Why did you kill her?


37:07.780 --> 37:09.590
I'm sorry.


37:09.610 --> 37:12.400
I didn't kill your daughter.


37:13.610 --> 37:16.240
Then what are you doing here?


37:19.220 --> 37:21.640
I don't know.


37:37.570 --> 37:41.230
Right back at you.


37:43.780 --> 37:46.130
So,crocotta,huh?


37:46.240 --> 37:47.570
Yep.


37:47.620 --> 37:49.520
That would explain the flies.


37:49.570 --> 37:51.710
Yeah,it would.


37:54.360 --> 37:56.970
Hey,um...


37:57.010 --> 37:59.620
look,I'm sorry it wasn't dad.


38:00.640 --> 38:02.550
I gave you a hell of
a time on this one.


38:03.360 --> 38:05.010
No,you were right.


38:05.060 --> 38:07.970
Forget about it.


38:08.010 --> 38:10.410
I can't.


38:11.500 --> 38:12.600
I wanted to believe so badly


38:12.640 --> 38:15.010
That there was a way out of this.


38:17.080 --> 38:20.320
I mean,I'm staring down
the barrel at this thing...


38:21.250 --> 38:23.530
you know,hell...


38:23.850 --> 38:27.430
for real,forever, and I'm just...


38:27.480 --> 38:29.850
yeah.


38:32.480 --> 38:35.220
I'm scared,Sam.


38:36.250 --> 38:39.530
I'm really scared.


38:39.570 --> 38:41.950
I know.


38:44.990 --> 38:47.830
Ess I was willing to
believe anything --


38:47.880 --> 38:50.160
You know,last act
of a desperate man.


38:50.200 --> 38:51.900
There's nothing wrong
with having hope,you know.


38:51.950 --> 38:54.480
Hope doesn't get you jack squat.


38:54.530 --> 38:56.740
I can't expect dad to show up


38:56.790 --> 38:59.060
With some miracle
at the last minute.


38:59.110 --> 39:01.760
I can't expect
anybody to, you know?


39:02.970 --> 39:06.690
And the only person that can
get me out of this thing is me.


39:09.970 --> 39:12.020
And me.


39:16.320 --> 39:18.510
"And me"?


39:18.550 --> 39:19.460
What?


39:19.510 --> 39:21.250
Deep revelation, having
a real moment here,


39:21.300 --> 39:24.790
That's what you come
back with -- "And me"?


39:25.140 --> 39:26.040
Want a poem?


39:26.090 --> 39:28.320
Moment's gme


39:29.000 --> 39:32.160
Unbelievable. Roger smith...
