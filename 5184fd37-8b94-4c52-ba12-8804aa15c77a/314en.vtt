00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.700
I got a year to live and I'd
like to make the most of it.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.450
what do you say we kill some evil sons
of bitches and we raise a little hell?

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.690
I know how you feel,Dean.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.780
Dad's dead.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.680
He left a hole and it hurts
so bad that you can't take it.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm ok. I swear to the next person who ask
me if I'm ok,I am start to throw punches.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.030
There's no way to save me
from the pit,isn't it? no

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.530
You are gonna die. And this
is what you are gonna become.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.890
I don't want to go to hell.
we'll find a way to save you.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.800
let Dean out of his deal right now.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.630
I'm just a saleswoman. I
got a boss,like everybody.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.790
who holds the contract.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.190
I can't tell you.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.220
tell me what?

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.460
there's a new big uping
comer. Her name is Lilith.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.270
Lilith?

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.790

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.000
You know about this? Gee Sam, is

Hello.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.930
Ben?

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.870
Lind

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.460
I had to talk to you.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.260
You can't keep calling here.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.020
Ow,I know.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.220
Just tell me you
thought about it,please.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.210
There's nothing to think about.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.460
Don't say that.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.430
I can't. You know
I can't -- My wife.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.910
I'm begging you. Come
to me. Come to me,Ben.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.330
No.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.770
Linda,please. Please,just
leave me alone.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.970
I'm not gonna stop. I miss you,Ben.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.220
We can be together.
We can be happy.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.110
This is --
This is crazy.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.470
I love you forever.
Don't you love me?

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.820
You know I do.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.250
More than anything.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.970
But...

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.440
I'm sorry.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.860
Ben,wait.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.390
Okay,linda.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.920
You win.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.540
I'm coming.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.980
Yep. I got it. Okay,bye.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.700
So?

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.830
So,the professor doesn't know crap.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.260
Shocking. Pack your panties,Sammy.
We're hitting the road.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.410
What? What's up?

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.640
That was bobby.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.470
Some banker guy blew
his head off in ohio,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.570
And he thinks there's
a spirit involved.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.480
So you two were talking a case?

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.770
No,we were actually
talking about our feelings

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.560
And then our favorite boy bands.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.820
Yeah,we were talking a case.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.850
So,a spirit
-- What?

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.420
Yeah,well,banker was complaining

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.850
About some electrical problems
at his pad for,like,a week --

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.810
Phones going haywire,
computers flipping on and off.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.590
Huh?

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.420
Uh-Huh.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.710
This is not ringing your bell?

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.830
Well,sure,yeah,but,Dean,we're
on a case.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.120
Whose? Yours.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.930
Right,yeah. Could have fooled me.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.320
What the hell else
have we ha doing lately

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.810
Other than trying
to break your deal?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.280
Chasing our tails,that's what.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.320
Sam,we've talked to
every professor,witch,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.830
Soothsayer,and two-Bit
carny act in the lower 48.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.870
Nobody knows squat.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.140
And we can't find bela.
We can't find the colt.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.720
So until we actually
find something,

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.350
I'd like to do my job.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.660
Well,there's one thing we
haven't tried yet. No,Sam. No.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.890
Dean,we should summon ruby. I'm
not gonna have this fight with you.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.490
She says she knows how to
save you! Well,she can't!

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.980
Oh,really? You know
that for sure? I do.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.590
How? Because she told me,okay?

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.610
What?

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.020
She told me...

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.720
flat-Out

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.810
that she could not
save me -- Nobody can.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.570
And you just somehow neglected
to mention this to me?

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.590
Well,you know,I really don't
care what that bitch thinks,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.300
And neither should you,so...

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.760
so what -- Now you're
keeping secretfrom me,Dean?

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.920
You really want to wk about
who's keeping secrets from who?

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.780
Now where are you going?

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.600
Guess I'm going to ohig

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.790
I found him...there.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.330
Why don't you just tell us
everything you saw,mrs. Waters?

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.330
You mean besides my dead husband?

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.810
Well,just everything
else...you saw,please.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.040
There was,uh,blood...everywhere.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.920
The phone was ripped from the wall,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.420
His favorite scotch on the desk.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.860
What else could yoco
possibly want to know?

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.350
Why was the phone
ripped from the wall?

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.380
I don't know.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:34.690
You mind if I take a look?

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.940
I already went over all this
with the other detectives.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.490
We'll be out of your
hair in no time nma'am.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.190
Ma'am,what time did
your husband die?

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.250
Sometime after 11:00.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.690
What about strange phone cas?

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.640
Receive any of
those lately --

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.720
Weird interference,static,
anything like that?

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.600
No.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.950
No.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.670
Mrs. Waters,withholding
information from the police

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.980
Is a capital off

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.620
In some parts he world,I'm sure.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.690
A couple of weeks
ago,um,there was this...

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.780
this what?

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.160
I woke up one morning,
i heard Ben in his study.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.130
I thought he was
talking to a woman.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.220
What made you think that?

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.660
Because he kept calling her linda.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.560
The thing is...

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.350
i picked up the other line,

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.810
And...nobody was there.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.750
Ben was talking to
nobody. There was nothing?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.650
Just static.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.460
Did you ever speak to
Ben about this phone call?

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.480
No. I should have,but,no.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.810
Did he ever say who linda was?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.180
What difference does it make?!

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.740
There was no one on the other end!

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.150
Linda's a babe...

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.420
or was.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.610
Find her?

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:05.710
Yeah,linda bateman.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.150
***

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.780
So what happened? Drunk
driver hit Ben walked away.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.580
So,what -- Dead
flame calls to chat?

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.190
You would think,but
linda was cremated.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.270
So why is she still
floating around?

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.830
Uh,you got me.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.970
What about that,uh,caller i.D.?

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.440
Turns out it's a phone number.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.040
It's no phone number ever seen.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.750
Yeah,because it's
about a century old

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.400
From back when phones sd cranks.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.390
***

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.670
You got me there,too,

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.000
But either way,we
should run a trace on it.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.120
Well,how the hell are we gonna trace
a number that's over 100 years old?

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.110
We don't get too many
folks from h.Q. Down here.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.500
Yes,well,office mentioned

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.460
That there would be a lunch.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.380
Well,I'm sure we can
arrange something.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.760
The man you gentlemen want to
be speaking to is right this --

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.950
I know. Sorry.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.760
Got something of a hygiene
issue down here,if you ask me.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.440
Stewie?

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.290
What did I tell you about
keeping this place clean?

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.420
Spam mail. Spam mail.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.300
***

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.990
I don't know how all this got here.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.720
...from headquarters.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.350
Oh.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.500
Give these gentlemen
whatever they need.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.810
Thank you. Thanks.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.810
So,can I help you?

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.670
Is that,uh,bustyasianbeauties.Com?

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.280
No.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.290
Maybe.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.760
Word to the wise -- Platinum
membership worth every penny.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.230
Right. Anyway,um,we're
here to trace a number.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.710
Where did you get this?

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.980
Off caller i.D. Oh,no.
That's impossible.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.640
Hasn't been used in
a few years. We know.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.120
"A few years." It's
prehistoric. Trust me.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.330
Nobody's using this number anymore.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.100
Sure. Could you run it anyways?

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.000
Sure. Why don't I just
rearrange my whole life first?

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.570
Listen,uh,stewie.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.660
You got like six kinds

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.620
Of employee-Code
violations down here,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.410
Not to mention the sickening porn

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.050
Clogging up your hard drive.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.930
When my partner
says run the number,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.930
I suggest you run the number.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.630
Holy crap. What?

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.010
I can't tell you where
the number comes from.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.490
But I can tell you
where it's been going.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:31.860
What do you mean?

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.010
10 different houses
in the past two weeks

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.520
All got calls from the Same number.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.730
So,are we,e here?

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.260
'Cause I was sort of busy.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.850
Right.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:25.850
Yeah.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.470
Hello,sir. I'm with

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.130
Uh,we didn't call
the phone company.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.060
Oh,no,sir. No,see,we're
calling you.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.330
We've had a lot of complaints from
the neighborhood lately. Compla

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.000
Yes,sir,uh,droppecalls,static,s

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.220
Maybe even strange voices
on the other end of thne?

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.930
No,we haven't had any of that here.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.200
Nothing? No.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.500
Okay,uh,great. Just
thought we'd check. Thanks.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.220
No problem.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.570
Let's go.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.770
No way you work for
the phone company.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.100
Sure,I do.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.200
Since when does a
phone guy drive a rental

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.940
Or wear a cheap suit?

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.670
Yeah? Well,maybe
we're both keg secrets.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.920
D you ask my dad if we heard
strange voices on the phone?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.670
Why? Did you hear something? No.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.020
My mistake. Thought maybe you did.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.440
Well,I didn't,okay?

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.370
Okay. Sorry to bother you.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:44.850
Because,you know...

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:47.620
if you did,

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.330
Then I would have
told you that I've been

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.930
Right where you're
standing right now.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:55.930
Hearing things,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.090
Even seeing things that
couldn't be explained.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.620
Maybe I would have been able
to help out a little bit.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.800
Yways...

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.110
wait.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.410
Maybe...

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.560
...maybe I've been
talking on the phone...

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:20.970
th
--

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.230
With my mom.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.460
Well,that's not so stra s

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.310
She's dead...

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.440
like three years now dead.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
How often does she call you?

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.300
A few times.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.700
It started a week ago.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.200
I thought I was,like,crazy
or something.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.100
Well,I can tell you
one thing for sure,

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.100
And you're gonna have to
go with me on this,okay?

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.000
You're not crazy.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.800
Dude,stiffs are calling
people all over town.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.000
Tell me about it

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I just talked to an enghty years gradmother
Who's having phone sex with her husband...

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.800
- who died in korea.
- Ugh.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.400
Completely rocked my understanding
Of the word "necrophilia."

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.800
So,what the hell's
going on here,Dean?

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.500
Beats me,but we
better find out soon.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.300
This place is turning
into spook central.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.200
Yeah. All right,I'll
call you later.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.000
Yep.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.600
Yeah,what?

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.500
Sam?

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.500
Dean.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.300
Dean,is that you?

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.300
Dad?

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.100
I mean Dad?

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.300
You really think it was dad?

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.100
I don't know. Maybe.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.200
Well,what did he sound like?

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.100
Like oprah. It was dad.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.400
He sounded like dad.
What do you think?

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.800
What did he say?

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.500
My name.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.800
That's it?

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.400
Yeah,the call dropped out.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Why would not he call
in the first place,Dean?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.900
I don't know,man. Why are ghosts
calling anybody in this town?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
But I mean,other people are
hearing from their loved ones.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.400
Why can't we? It's at
least a possibility,right?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.800
Yeah,I guess.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.000
Okay,so what...

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.700
what if it really is dad?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.500
What happens if he calls back?

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.100
What do you mean?

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.800
What do I say?

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.900
"Hello"?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.100
"Hello"?

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.000
What you come back
with -- "Hello"?

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.600
"hello"

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.200
Find anything?

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.200
After three hours,i
have found no reason

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.300
Why anything supernatural
would be going on here.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.400
Wow,you know,you'd think
a stanford education

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.100
And a high-School
hookup rate of 0.0

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.000
Would produce better
results than that.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.300
Hilarious.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.400
Sam,you're just looking
in the wrong places,pal.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.400
And what are the right places,Dean?

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.100
Motel pamphlet rack.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.500
Milan,ohio -- Birthplace
of thomas edison.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.300
Yeah,right. So what?

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.000
Keep reading.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.500
You're kidding.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.600
And we're walking.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.600
And here we have
one of the museum's

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.800
Most unique and
treasured possessions --

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.600
Thomas edison's "spirit phone."

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.300
Did you know that mr. Edison,

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.600
While being one of america's
most beloved inventors,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.000
Was also a devout "occultist"?

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.500
Ooh-Ooh.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.300
What's with the quotey fingers?

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.500
He spent years working on this
- his final invention

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.000
Which he was
convinced could be used

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.100
To "communicate" with the "dead."

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.600
Pretty spooky,huh?

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.800
And we're walking. We are walking.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.400
And we are not touching
that. And we are walking.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.300
Anything?

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.000
Nothing.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.300
What do you think?

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.700
Honestly?

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.700
It kind of looks like an
old pile of junk to me.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.200
It's not even plugged in.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.200
- Maybe it doesn't work like that.
- Okay.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.800
Maybe it's like a radio tower,

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.700
You know,broadcasting
the dead all over town.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.700
Could be.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.800
Well,you know,the caller
i.D.'S 100 years old,right?

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.300
Right around the time
this thing was built.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.100
Yeah,but why would it all
of a sudden ssu working now?

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.000
I don't know.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.800
But as long as the moldy are
calling the freshes around here,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.300
It's the best reason we got.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.700
Yeah,maybe.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.600
So maybe it really is dad.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.800
Dad?

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.300
Dean.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.700
Is it really you?

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.500
It's me.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:12.900
How can I be sure?

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.600
You can't.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.000
Dean,how could you do it?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.600
Do what?

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.300
Sell your soul.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.300
I was looking after
Sammy like you told me to.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.800
I never wanted
this --Never.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
You're my boy. I love you.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.900
I can't watch you go to hell,Dean.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.600
I'm sorry. I don't
know how to stop it

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.000
Because if you break
the deal,Sam dies,right?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.300
What?

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.700
- Well,I know a way out...for both of you.
- How?

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.100
The demon who holds
your contract --

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.400
He's here...now.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.400
(ok,see you tomorrow)

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.600
(Lanie? Is that you?)

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.700
(Mom?)

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.600
(I asked you a question last
night. Have you thought about it?)

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.100
(I don't know what you want Of
course you do. I want to see you)

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.500
(I went to see you.
At the cemetery.)

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.000
(That's not what I mean.)

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.100
(But I am scared.)

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.000
(Don't be scared. I am
right here with you.)

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.800
(come to me)

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.200
What's up?

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.900
Girl lanie
--Her mom's ghost

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.100
Spooked her out
pretty bad last night.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.800
- That sucks.
- Yeah,it does.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.800
What are you doing?

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.600
I think dad's right.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.600
I think the demon is here.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.300
Check it out.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.100
What is this
--Weather reports?

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.400
Omens --
Demonic omens --

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.700
Electrical storms everywhere
we've beenFor the past two weeks.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.600
I-I don't remember
any lightning storms.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.500
Well,I don't remember you studying
meteorology as a kid,either.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.100
But I'm telling you -- That
bastard's been tailing me,

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.900
Wearing some poor dude's meat.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.600
And it's following you because...?

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.700
I guess I'm big game,you know?

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.300
My ass is too sweet
to let out of sight.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.000
Okay,sure.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.800
Don't get too excited,Sammy.
You might pull something.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.100
Dean,look,I want to believe
this,man. I really do.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.600
Then believe it!

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.400
I mean,if we get this
sucker,it's miller time.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.200
Yeah,that's another thing.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.500
Dad rattles off an exorcism
that can kill a demon --

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.900
I mean,not just send it
back to hell,but kill it?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.500
I checked it out.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.200
This is heavy-Duty dark ages.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.300
15th century.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.500
Yeah,I checked on it,too,Dean.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.900
And so did bobby.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.900
Okay. and?

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.200
Look,it definitely
is an exorcism,okay?

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.100
There's just no evidence
that it can kill a demon.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.500
- No evidence it can't.
- Dean,come on.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.200
Hey,as far as I
know,the only one of us

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.300
That's actually been
to hell is dad,okay?

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.900
Think maybe he picked up a
couple of tricks down there --

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.400
- Like which exorcisms work?
- Maybe it does,okay?

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.900
- Look,I hope it does,too,but we just got to be sure.
- Why aren't we sure?

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.600
Because I don't know what's
going on around here,Dean.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.700
I mean,some guy
blows his brains out,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
A little girl is
scared out of her wits.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.500
Wow,man! A couple of civvies
are freaked out by some ghosts.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.700
News
flash,Sam --

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.000
People are supposed to
be freaked out by ghosts!

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.600
Dad tell you where
to find the demon?

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.000
I'm waiting on the call!

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.800
I told lanie I'd stop by.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.200
Oh,good,yeah.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.100
No,you go hang out with jailbait.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.900
Just watch out for chris hansen.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.400
Meanwhile,I'll be here,you know,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.700
Getting ready to save my life.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.100
You are unbelievable,you know that?

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.700
I mean,for months we've been
trying to break this demon deal.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.600
Now dad's about to give
us the freakin' address,

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.000
And you can't accept it?!

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.300
The man is dead,and you're
still butting heads with the guy!

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.800
- That is not what this is about.
- Then what is it?!

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.600
The fact is,we got no
hard proof here,Dean.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.700
After everything,you're still
just going on blind faith!

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.500
Yeah,well,maybe! You know,
maybe that's all I got,okay?!

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.700
Please.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.200
Just please don't go anywhere

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.100
Until I get back,okay,Dean?

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.800
Please.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.300
Have you told your
father about any of this?

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.800
And bother him at work? No.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.800
He wouldn't believe me anyway.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.100
He'd just chuck me into therapy.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.200
So what did your mother say?

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.600
That she wanted to see me.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.300
So,at first,I thought I was
supposed to go to the cemetery.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.800
- Did you?
- Nothing happened.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.300
But then she started asking
me to do other things.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.500
What sort of things?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.400
Bad things.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:51.300
Hello? Simon greenfield speaking.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.800
Hi,mommy.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.500
- Yeah,I want to see you.
- Where are you?

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.100
Dad?

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:05.900
Dean.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.300
Where's the demon?

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.700
Lanie,please. Tell
me what happened.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.700
It's very important.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.400
Mom told me to go to
dad's medicine cabinet.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.000
And?

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.500
Take his sleeping pills --
Take all his sleeping pills!

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.000
She wanted you to kill yourself?

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.160
Why would my mom
want me to do that?

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.110
I don't know.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.120
I mean,just so I could come to her?

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.160
What'd you say?

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.560
She wanted me to come to her.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.000
No,no,no,no,no. How
did she say it exactly?

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.580
"Come to me --"
Like,a million times.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.000
Lanie, that's not your mother.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.280
All right,listen to me.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.350
Don't answer the phone.
Don't use the computer.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.380
Don't do anything unless
i say to,all right?

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.580
Lanie.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.230
Where's simon?

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.820
Hello?

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.050
Dean,it's not dad. What is it?

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.700
A crocotta. Is that a sandwich?

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.660
Some kind of scavenger
-- Mimics loved ones,

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.870
Whispers "come to me,"

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.380
and loses you in the dark
and swallows your soul.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.050
Crocotta -- Right.
Damn,that makes sense.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.520
Dean,look. I'm
sorry,man. I know --

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.400
Hey,don't these things
live in filth? Yeah.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.910
Sam,the flies at the phone company.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.270
This is herman munster.
Leave a message.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.710
Dean,I'm in the parking
lot. He's here. Hurry.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.240
Whoa,what the hell?!

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.290
I know what you are.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.220
Wait,mister,please. And
I know how to kill you.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:44.590
Okay,wait,wait.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.250
If we're overcharging
you for the call-Waiting

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.830
Something, i --
I can fix that.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.080
I'm your friend.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.640
Just -- Just
don't kill me.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.760
Don't kill me,please!

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.060
Yeah!

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.040
That's what happens

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.710
When you mess with the
phone company,dillweed!

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.590
Thank you,clark.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.920
Forget about it.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.040
Clark?

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.710
I'm -- I'm
sorry,clark.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.480
I'm sorry for
whatever I did to you.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:29.020
I'm sorry. Please.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.410
Wait! Wait. Don't do it.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.480
You're awake.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:38.020
You're not a killer,clark. No!

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.320
There's a -- There's a good
man inside of you. I know it.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.830
What do you think,Sammy?

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.370
Am I a good man?

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.950
Just let him go.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.620
I would. I really would.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.740
If only I'd had more
than a salad for lunch.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.620
See...

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:58.990
I'm starving.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.860
No! Ugh!

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.230
My last call
with Dean --

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.300
It was you.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.670
You led me here.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:47.370
Some calls I make,
some calls I take.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:52.420
But you have to admit, i
had you fooled for a while.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.230
All that edison phone crap...

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.700
oh,well.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.600
What are you doing?

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.370
I'm killing your brother.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.730
Or maybe I'm killing another guy.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.670
We'll just have to see how it goes.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.720
Hello?

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.500
Hi,daddy.

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.430
Hey,baby.

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.890
I thought you said you
weren't gonna call anymore.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.770
I know,daddy.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.610
You know how sad this
makes your old man.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.510
How upset I was at your funeral.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.970
I had to call. I know
who killed me,daddy.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.770
What?

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:59.470
The man who killed me --
He's at the house right now.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.100
What -- What are
you saying to me?

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.630
He's at the house,daddy.
He wants to kill you,too.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.470
You know,mimicking
Dean's one thing.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.560
But my dad -- That's
a hell of a trick.

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:24.130
Ll,once I made you two
as hunters,it was easy.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.030
Found Dean's number,
then your number,

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.240
Then your father's numbers,

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:38.730
Then to e-Mails,voice
mails -- Everything.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:43.290
You see,people think that
that stuff just gets erased.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:45.450
But it doesn't.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.380
You'd be surprised at
how much of yourself

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.240
Is just floating out there,

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.030
waiting to be plucked.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.570
Dean's not gonna fall for this.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.680
He's not gonna kill that guy.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.100
Then the guy killsuy

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:21.830
Technology...

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:27.270
...makes life so much easier.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.110
It used to be I'd -- I'd
hide in the woods for days,

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.880
Weeks,

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.830
whispering to people,

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:41.200
Trying to draw them
out into the night.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.580
But they had community.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.130
They all looked out
after each other.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.670
I'd be lucky to eat maybe
one, two souls a year.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:55.880
But now when I'm hungry,
i simply make a phone call.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.830
You're all so connected...

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.040
but you've never been so alone.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.320
What is this?

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:43.440
Your funeral.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.210
???

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.770
??

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:51.140
???

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.670
Did you do this to my daughter,too?

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.670
- How the hell did you get out?
- Did you do this to my daughter,too?!

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.980
- Wait.This is a mistake.
- You killed her.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.350
You killed her, you son of a bitch!

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.890
She was 9 years old!

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.000
Stop! I didn't!

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.700
You got to believe me!

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:56.350
Why did you kill her?

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.190
I'm sorry.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.000
I didn't kill your daughter.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.840
Then what are you doing here?

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.240
I don't know.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:29.830
Right back at you.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.730
So,crocotta,huh?

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.170
Yep.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.120
That would explain the flies.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:40.310
Yeah,it would.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.570
Hey,um...

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.220
look,I'm sorry it wasn't dad.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.150
I gave you a hell of
a time on this one.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.610
No,you were right.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.570
Forget about it.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.010
I can't.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.200
I wanted to believe so badly

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.610
That there was a way out of this.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.920
I mean,I'm staring down
the barrel at this thing...

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:12.130
you know,hell...

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.030
for real,forever, and I'm just...

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.450
yeah.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.820
I'm scared,Sam.

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:28.130
I'm really scared.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.550
I know.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.430
Ess I was willing to
believe anything --

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.760
You know,last act
of a desperate man.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.500
There's nothing wrong
with having hope,you know.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:43.080
Hope doesn't get you jack squat.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.340
I can't expect dad to show up

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.660
With some miracle
at the last minute.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.360
I can't expect
anybody to, you know?

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:55.290
And the only person that can
get me out of this thing is me.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.620
And me.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.110
"And me"?

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:08.060
What?

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.850
Deep revelation, having
a real moment here,

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.390
That's what you come
back with -- "And me"?

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.640
Want a poem?

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:16.920
Moment's gme

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.760
Unbelievable. Roger smith...
