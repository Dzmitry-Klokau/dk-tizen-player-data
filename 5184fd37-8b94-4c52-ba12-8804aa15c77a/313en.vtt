Lazy fat cats.

02:45.990 --> 02:49.040
Balancing our daytime careers
with our nighttime missions.


02:49.310 --> 02:51.570
Yeah, but Ed and I
pretty much call the shots


02:51.710 --> 02:52.780
At the kinko's where we work,


02:53.830 --> 02:56.140
So we can usually pretty much
get off by 6:00 every night?


02:56.830 --> 02:57.760
Yeah, 6:00.


02:57.880 --> 03:00.820
It's used to be just, you know,
you and I taking on the cases --


03:01.400 --> 03:02.380
Just Harry and me.


03:02.560 --> 03:03.310
Two lone wolves.


03:03.580 --> 03:07.100
And two lone wolves need, uh...


03:07.870 --> 03:08.740
Other wolves.


03:12.960 --> 03:13.810
Morning, 'facers.


03:14.040 --> 03:15.670
Good morning, Ghostfacers.


03:16.350 --> 03:17.380
It's 7:00 p.m., dude.


03:17.880 --> 03:18.920
It's morning to a Ghostfacer.


03:19.880 --> 03:20.920
Corbett, what do we got, buddy?


03:21.040 --> 03:22.190
Oh, I'm just putting
up some of the --


03:22.350 --> 03:24.220
Yeah, this has got to go up here.


03:24.320 --> 03:25.340
That's got to go here.
got to see the whole field.


03:25.440 --> 03:26.920
Markers, eraser
-- good job.


03:27.450 --> 03:28.830
I first saw Ed


03:30.610 --> 03:32.800
Putting up flyers
down at the --


03:34.000 --> 03:35.500
The outlet mall in scogan,


03:36.610 --> 03:38.030
So i-i read one,


03:38.680 --> 03:41.530
And I thought to myself, "huh.


03:42.750 --> 03:44.190
Where do ghosts come from?"


03:44.850 --> 03:46.930
And now here I am.


03:54.130 --> 03:55.580
Ed, your sister's abusing staff.


03:55.790 --> 03:57.660
That's adopted sister,
thank you very much.


03:58.520 --> 04:01.700
Ed has been obsessEd with the
supernatural since we were kids,


04:01.950 --> 04:05.140
You know, and then he meets
Harry at computer camp,


04:05.620 --> 04:06.620
And love at first geek.


04:09.090 --> 04:09.740
Spruce here.


04:10.470 --> 04:13.160
What up, player?


04:13.490 --> 04:17.980
I am 15/16 jew, 1/16 cherokee.


04:18.280 --> 04:20.150
My grandfather is a mohel,


04:20.370 --> 04:24.820
My great-grandfather
was a tallis maker,


04:24.910 --> 04:28.670
And my great-great-grandfather
was a degenerate gambler


04:29.310 --> 04:31.210
And had a peyote addiction.


04:31.440 --> 04:34.620
Okay, people. let's cut the
chatter and get on a mission.


04:35.440 --> 04:36.020
Okay?


04:36.820 --> 04:38.140
Morton house...


04:40.950 --> 04:42.070
...one of our big fish.


04:43.070 --> 04:44.290
All right, we all know the legend.


04:44.550 --> 04:46.440
Every four years, supposedly,


04:46.640 --> 04:49.520
This becomes the most
haunted place in america.


04:51.640 --> 04:53.140
The leap year ghost, some call it.


04:54.480 --> 04:57.640
The ghost returns at midnight
just as february 29th begins.


04:57.890 --> 04:59.580
And no one has ever
stayed the night, right?


04:59.780 --> 05:01.380
Yeah, well, every
testimony that we dug up,


05:02.220 --> 05:04.150
Every eyewitness has cut
and run well before midnight.


05:04.290 --> 05:06.260
Well, that's all
about to change, baby.


05:06.400 --> 05:07.230
Absolutely true, Ed.


05:07.550 --> 05:08.630
Absolutely true.


05:08.990 --> 05:09.710
Mmm. that's good.


05:10.200 --> 05:12.360
It's french vanilla,
cause the other day,


05:12.740 --> 05:14.430
You said how much
you liked it, so...


05:15.390 --> 05:15.970
Thank you.


05:17.780 --> 05:18.820
You are welcome.


05:25.410 --> 05:26.990
I like Corbett. I do.


05:28.770 --> 05:32.500
Shows up early, does his
job, lot of good hustle out --


05:39.790 --> 05:41.100
I think he's got the hots for Ed,


05:41.600 --> 05:43.410
And that could spell
trouble for the whole team.


05:43.670 --> 05:44.850
Ed's kind of the more ruggEd,


05:45.110 --> 05:47.860
With that really golden...


05:49.780 --> 05:51.310
Beautiful sort of beard.


05:51.930 --> 05:52.600
Definitely nice.


05:53.750 --> 05:55.860
Uh, and Harry's nice.


05:56.620 --> 06:00.360
29th is this friday, facers.


06:00.740 --> 06:01.810
We want this mission,


06:01.920 --> 06:03.820
We got to move on it
now, or guess what --


06:04.030 --> 06:05.440
He's gone for another four years.


06:05.940 --> 06:06.620
Oh, watch out!


06:06.780 --> 06:07.590
Who is that?


06:12.750 --> 06:13.860
Dad! told you we were gonna
have the garage right now.


06:13.890 --> 06:16.040
Just cut the cameras.
we don't need that.


06:16.270 --> 06:17.250
We don't need this
part. we don't --


06:24.160 --> 06:25.880
Stay low. follow formation.


06:28.120 --> 06:30.030
Okay, as suspected.


06:32.300 --> 06:34.320
A lot of people have tried to
break into the Morton house.


06:34.800 --> 06:37.370
The local authorities
have just gotten fed up.


06:37.430 --> 06:38.910
Looks like the cops
have got this place


06:39.110 --> 06:40.230
Pretty well fenced off.


06:42.150 --> 06:42.560
Wait.


06:42.870 --> 06:44.730
Didn't you guys get, like,
a permit or something?


06:45.130 --> 06:47.300
A permit? that's a
good idea for next time.


06:47.860 --> 06:48.350
Yeah.


06:49.720 --> 06:50.110
Car!


06:50.540 --> 06:51.400
Car. shh, shh!


06:51.580 --> 06:52.440
Flashlights off.


07:22.710 --> 07:24.520
It's okay. not
cops -- just hicks.


07:29.070 --> 07:29.690
Oh, right on.


07:29.720 --> 07:30.380
Guys, let's go! let's go! let's go!


07:30.410 --> 07:33.470
Go! go!


07:35.800 --> 07:38.590
Hear that, people?
let's keep it quiet.


07:47.200 --> 07:48.130
There's the kitchen sink.


07:48.440 --> 07:49.140
Copy that. copy that.


07:54.390 --> 07:55.070
All right, everybody.


07:55.450 --> 07:56.970
Ghostfacers, let's line up.


07:57.720 --> 07:58.230
Everybody.


07:59.400 --> 08:02.110
We'll set up camp right here.
this is command center one.


08:02.330 --> 08:03.700
We'll call this the eagle's nest.


08:23.430 --> 08:24.620
Hallway cam one up and running.


08:24.910 --> 08:25.920
Looking good, Corbett.


08:27.840 --> 08:29.290
Copy that, Ed.


08:30.380 --> 08:32.970
Uh...uh, you're welcome.


08:33.340 --> 08:34.780
All right, Spruce, how

08:34.970 --> 08:37.220
Checking basement

08:37.360 --> 08:38.990
Maggie, I got no
visual on you, Maggie.


08:39.160 --> 08:41.140
This is Maggie. do you

08:41.280 --> 08:43.150
Harry, are you alive?

08:43.580 --> 08:45.080
Looking good. I can
smell syndication.


08:45.340 --> 08:47.870
All right, fellas. let's
regroup at the eagle nest.


08:49.670 --> 08:50.340
All right, Spangler.


08:51.310 --> 08:52.730
Battery check,

08:52.790 --> 08:53.710
Okay.


08:53.780 --> 08:54.610
Check. check.


08:56.560 --> 08:57.790
Yo, robocop.


08:59.180 --> 09:00.170
R-robocop?


09:00.190 --> 09:02.920
You think I -- you think
I look like robocop?


09:03.160 --> 09:04.410
Everybody, bring
it in. bring it in.


09:04.860 --> 09:07.040
We've all been here before.
standard walk-through.


09:07.480 --> 09:10.070
Team one, west. team two, east.


09:11.150 --> 09:12.340
Spin the tires, light the fires.


09:12.540 --> 09:13.400
Ghostfacers on three.


09:13.910 --> 09:15.280
1, 2, 3...


09:15.510 --> 09:17.220
Ghostfacers!


09:26.500 --> 09:27.230
Hello!


09:29.280 --> 09:32.560
I'm speaking to the restless
spirits of the Morton house!


09:33.970 --> 09:36.290
Okay.


09:37.950 --> 09:38.750
Hello!


09:39.130 --> 09:40.290
My name's Ed.


09:45.030 --> 09:45.440
Careful.


09:48.260 --> 09:49.340
Watch my back.


09:49.740 --> 09:50.690
Okay. okay.


09:54.110 --> 09:54.870
What's your name?


09:57.300 --> 09:58.300
.3, .29.


10:00.160 --> 10:03.500
Is there an entity or
entities here with us now?


10:04.690 --> 10:06.080
Can you give us a
sign of your presence?


10:06.440 --> 10:07.620
You got to breathe,
buddy. I can't breathe.


10:12.770 --> 10:13.840
Corbett, night vision.


10:14.470 --> 10:15.510
Okay. okay. yeah.


10:17.940 --> 10:19.490
Calm down, buddy.
breathe, all right?


10:19.940 --> 10:22.080
Calm the whirlwinds of your mind.


10:26.470 --> 10:30.340
We're doing a basic emf,
evp, temp-flux sweep.


10:31.530 --> 10:33.490
Looks like we've got all
of our ducks in a row here.


10:44.390 --> 10:44.820
What?


10:45.680 --> 10:48.020
I don't know. it's weird.


10:54.600 --> 10:55.200
It's gone.


10:57.700 --> 10:59.100
All right. get this. get this.


11:02.440 --> 11:03.280
Turn the knob.


11:03.310 --> 11:03.850
All right...


11:07.530 --> 11:08.630
Oh, my god! oh, my god!


11:08.980 --> 11:10.130
Oh, my god! oh, my god!


11:10.380 --> 11:11.620
Oh, my god! oh, my god!


11:13.150 --> 11:15.820
I don't really like rats.


11:16.960 --> 11:17.940
They're gross.


11:18.860 --> 11:21.690
Rats are like the
rats of the world.


11:22.580 --> 11:24.260
What -- was that
an apparition?


11:24.530 --> 11:25.840
Was that a spectral
-- was that a .4?


11:25.980 --> 11:27.940
What do we got, 'cause
the emp was just off the --


11:28.260 --> 11:29.430
Oh, god!


11:29.950 --> 11:31.430
Oh, that is so not funny, Spruce!


11:38.520 --> 11:39.930
Oh, god. okay, it was just...


11:40.450 --> 11:41.430
I think it was just this branch...


11:41.990 --> 11:44.130
Okay...in the window.


11:44.860 --> 11:45.700
This is spooky, man.


11:45.880 --> 11:46.420
This place...


11:47.090 --> 11:47.570
Okay.


11:48.640 --> 11:49.670
Oh, no!


11:49.760 --> 11:51.620
Freeze! police
officers! don't move!


11:53.190 --> 11:54.420
All right. all right. all right.


11:54.510 --> 11:55.390
Let's see some identification.


11:55.650 --> 11:56.770
Come on. let's see some i.d.


11:57.030 --> 11:58.980
What -- are we under
-- under arrest?


11:59.020 --> 11:59.530
We are unarmed.


11:59.920 --> 12:01.590
Oh, god. oh, god.


12:01.770 --> 12:04.710
Want to explain that
weirdo outfit, mr. Corbett?


12:06.380 --> 12:07.090
I know you.


12:08.290 --> 12:09.830
Yeah, sure you do. give
me some identification.


12:09.920 --> 12:10.870
Yeah, ho-- whoa,

12:10.940 --> 12:12.350
I know the both of you guys. yeah.


12:12.530 --> 12:14.240
What? yeah. huh.


12:15.290 --> 12:15.800
Holy


12:17.380 --> 12:17.820
What?


12:19.080 --> 12:20.490
Uh, west
texas --


12:20.710 --> 12:22.730
The -- the -- the tulpa
we had to take out,


12:22.840 --> 12:24.690
Those two goofballs that
almost got us killed...


12:25.810 --> 12:26.920
The hellhounds or something?


12:31.220 --> 12:31.680
Me.


12:31.880 --> 12:33.120
Yeah, we're not
hellhounds anymore, okay?


12:33.230 --> 12:34.590
It didn't test that
well. Ed, what's going on?


12:34.780 --> 12:36.290
They're not cops,
buddy -- no, not at all.


12:36.350 --> 12:38.220
Ed, Ed, you had a
partner, too, didn't you --


12:38.320 --> 12:38.890
A different guy?


12:39.020 --> 12:40.260
Oh, yeah, yeah. is he
around here somewhere?


12:40.410 --> 12:41.800
He's running around,
chasing ghosts.


12:41.960 --> 12:43.690
Okay, well, listen, you and rambo


12:43.860 --> 12:45.110
Need to get your girlfriends
and get out of here.


12:46.470 --> 12:46.940
All right.


12:47.990 --> 12:49.530
Listen here, chisel chest, okay?


12:50.300 --> 12:53.300
We were here first. we've
already set up base camp.


12:54.130 --> 12:54.790
We beat you.


12:56.450 --> 12:57.220
They were here first.


12:58.930 --> 12:59.910
Oh, god.


13:01.020 --> 13:01.560
Ed... yeah?


13:01.850 --> 13:03.750
...where's your partner?


13:06.000 --> 13:08.270
10.6. 10.7, guys.


13:08.370 --> 13:09.570
The emf is really spiking here.


13:09.810 --> 13:11.180
Pressure's down, like, 11 degrees.


13:11.560 --> 13:12.360
All right, all right,
keep your eyes peeled.


13:12.990 --> 13:13.530
This could be it.


13:15.170 --> 13:16.420
Maggie, can I get a
reading in here, please?


13:21.020 --> 13:22.350
Something keeps
messing with the chip.


13:22.610 --> 13:23.610
I don't know what's going on here.


13:25.340 --> 13:27.740
Guys. guys. guys.


13:29.080 --> 13:31.410
I'm sorry. that's it.


13:32.120 --> 13:33.440
I'm telling you, that's
all the money I --


13:46.000 --> 13:47.150
On leap year -- what
are you thinking?


13:47.350 --> 13:49.870
We're here to spend the night,
okay? it's for our tv show.


13:50.270 --> 13:52.110
What? great. perfect.


13:52.330 --> 13:53.890
Yeah, nobody's ever
spent the night before.


13:54.050 --> 13:55.260
Uh, actually, yeah, they have.


13:55.480 --> 13:56.470
Uh, we've never heard of them.


13:57.070 --> 13:57.710
Yeah, you know why?


13:58.120 --> 14:00.290
Cause the ones that have
haven't lived to talk about it!


14:00.880 --> 14:02.430
Oh, come on, I don't believe you.


14:02.600 --> 14:04.190
Look --
missing-persons reports


14:04.360 --> 14:05.620
Going back almost a half century.


14:07.360 --> 14:09.980
John graham stayed
on a dare -- gone.


14:10.150 --> 14:12.320
Julie wilkerson -- gone.
there are tons more.


14:12.600 --> 14:14.670
All of them came to just
stay the night through,


14:14.790 --> 14:15.710
Always on a leap year.


14:15.900 --> 14:17.230
The only body they ever found


14:17.360 --> 14:19.070
Was the last owner,
Freeman Daggett.


14:19.200 --> 14:20.810
These look legit. they are legit.


14:21.000 --> 14:22.610
Look, Ed, we ain't got
much time here, buddy.


14:22.960 --> 14:24.990
Starting at midnight, your
friends are going to die.


14:25.270 --> 14:26.600
Oh, my god! oh, my god!


14:26.840 --> 14:28.810
Oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god!


14:29.000 --> 14:31.900
Guys! guys! oh, my god!
oh, my god! we got one!


14:32.040 --> 14:33.590
Corbett! Corbett, we
saw one! we saw one!


14:34.080 --> 14:36.220
It was a full apparition!
it was like a class four.


14:36.420 --> 14:37.800
It was a spectral
illumination! it...


14:42.290 --> 14:44.450
Hey, aren't those the  from texas?


14:44.970 --> 14:45.510
Yes.


14:46.130 --> 14:48.060
All right, let's have this
reunion across the street, guys.


14:48.060 --> 14:48.940
Crap. what are you guys
doing here? come on, come on.


14:49.120 --> 14:50.290
We'll get you ice
cream -- our treat.


14:50.480 --> 14:51.370
What do you say? let's go.


14:51.720 --> 14:52.990
Yeah, I say no. look at
this. look, look. Ed, Ed.


14:53.300 --> 14:54.410
No. no. look at this.


14:54.620 --> 14:56.320
Okay, honest-to-god
proof, all right?


15:00.620 --> 15:01.530
Are you kidding me?


15:01.730 --> 15:02.390
Yeah. no, not kidding.


15:02.670 --> 15:03.600
What kind of reading did we get?


15:03.710 --> 15:05.120
Uh, it was a 10.9.


15:05.500 --> 15:06.250
10.9?


15:06.500 --> 15:08.120
Yeah, it was 10.9.
it was almost 11.


15:08.320 --> 15:09.990
I came out, and I was
like, "what's going on?"


15:10.120 --> 15:11.620
And I was like --
wait, watch this.


15:13.000 --> 15:14.090
Oh! he got blasted.


15:14.450 --> 15:14.990
It was crazy.


15:22.000 --> 15:22.910
What's a death echo?


15:23.190 --> 15:25.790
We got a problem here.
that ghost ain't it.


15:26.010 --> 15:27.510
Yeah, that's real.
like, that happened.


15:28.030 --> 15:28.840
What's a death echo?


15:29.680 --> 15:31.590
Echoes are trapped in a loop, okay?


15:32.110 --> 15:33.390
They keep replaying how they died


15:33.520 --> 15:34.640
Over and over and over again,


15:34.770 --> 15:36.020
Usually in the place
where they were ganked.


15:36.440 --> 15:38.090
It's about as dangerous
as a scary movie.


15:38.450 --> 15:40.580
Maybe the echo's not dangerous,
but maybe something else is.


15:40.800 --> 15:42.540
You're right. all right, we
need to get out of here, guys.


15:42.660 --> 15:43.890
Come on. let's go.
let's go. let's go.


15:44.020 --> 15:44.580
Pack it up.


15:49.420 --> 15:50.130
What about all of our equipment?


15:50.310 --> 15:52.290
Lots of fun. let's go.


15:52.780 --> 15:53.730
We got more material. we
got all kinds of stuff.


15:54.320 --> 15:55.060
We'll make you guys
recurring guest stars.


15:55.490 --> 15:56.050
Wait!


15:59.180 --> 15:59.830
Where's Corbett?


16:00.310 --> 16:03.350
I wish to communicate with
the restless spirits here.


16:10.140 --> 16:11.240
Uh, lights out?


16:11.870 --> 16:15.180
Oh, I think I got
night vision here.


16:21.740 --> 16:22.190
That's better.


16:23.140 --> 16:23.910
No man left behind.


16:27.530 --> 16:27.980
That was Corbett.


16:28.170 --> 16:28.700
That was Corbett! Corbett!


16:29.190 --> 16:29.960
Corbett! it's okay!


16:30.670 --> 16:31.820
We'll get him! go back!


16:32.260 --> 16:32.850
Guys!


16:34.950 --> 16:36.790
No! where are you, dude?


16:37.390 --> 16:38.270
Tell us where you are!


16:38.950 --> 16:39.370
Corbett!


16:39.710 --> 16:40.150
Let me go!


16:41.650 --> 16:42.380
Guys!


16:42.670 --> 16:43.760
Corbett, you need to
come back, Corbett.


16:44.010 --> 16:44.760
No!!


16:45.360 --> 16:45.990
Hey! hey! hey! come on.


16:55.200 --> 16:56.420
Corbett's...


16:56.970 --> 16:57.890
He's not here. let's go. let's go.


16:58.210 --> 17:00.050
No. no. no. but that's Corbett.


17:00.590 --> 17:02.020
No, that was Corbett.
didn't you hear that?


17:02.190 --> 17:03.160
Go, go, go, come on.


17:03.470 --> 17:05.110
Guys. guys. guys.


17:05.500 --> 17:07.080
Here we go. here we go. keep
it moving. keep it moving.


17:07.670 --> 17:08.280
Corbett?


17:09.800 --> 17:11.320
Hey. hey. hey.
watch him. watch him.


17:12.580 --> 17:13.570
Go. go. move. move.


17:14.130 --> 17:15.470
Turn it off!


17:16.360 --> 17:18.120
Oh, god, what's happened?


17:18.700 --> 17:20.440
Oh, god. he's gone.


17:21.660 --> 17:22.600
He just disappeared.


17:22.970 --> 17:24.790
Okay, let's just go
through all the angles.


17:25.060 --> 17:25.860
Let's go through all
the cameras we have.


17:26.090 --> 17:27.760
Well, it's 12:04, dean.
you good? you happy?


17:27.920 --> 17:28.560
Yeah, I am happy.


17:28.720 --> 17:29.980
"let's go hunt the
Morton house," you said.


17:30.170 --> 17:31.050
"it's our grand canyon."


17:31.240 --> 17:32.190
Sam, I don't want to hear this.


17:32.250 --> 17:32.930
You got two months left, dean.


17:33.730 --> 17:34.810
Instead, we're gonna die tonight.


17:36.100 --> 17:37.940
Whoa! what the hell is going on?


17:38.290 --> 17:39.120
I'll tell you what's going on.


17:39.700 --> 17:40.880
Every door, every window,


17:41.060 --> 17:42.520
I'm guessing every exit
out of this house --


17:42.930 --> 17:43.790
They're all sealed.


17:44.440 --> 17:45.360
But w-why are they sealed?


17:45.570 --> 17:46.920
It's a supernatural lockdown, okay?


17:47.090 --> 17:49.110
Whatever took Corbett
doesn't want us to leave,


17:49.290 --> 17:50.270
And it's no death echo.


17:50.410 --> 17:52.020
This is a bad mother,
and it wants us scared.


17:53.130 --> 17:54.000
Or it just wants us.


17:56.650 --> 17:59.520
Uh, guys, the camera's
fritzing again.


17:59.950 --> 18:02.210
Whoa. whoa. guys, the
emf's starting to spike.


18:02.840 --> 18:06.000
Everybody, stay close.
there's something coming.


18:15.550 --> 18:16.990
Is this the same echo
you guys saw earlier?


18:17.310 --> 18:18.430
No, it's a different guy.


18:18.760 --> 18:19.810
Multiple echoes? what
the hell's going on?


18:20.410 --> 18:20.910
Beats me.


18:21.790 --> 18:22.910
Okay. all right.
all right. all right.


18:23.610 --> 18:24.790
Uh, hey, buddy!


18:25.320 --> 18:28.300
Hey. hey. wake up. you're dead!


18:29.000 --> 18:29.610
Hello!


18:29.830 --> 18:31.270
What's he doing? what's he doing?


18:31.490 --> 18:33.620
It's rare, but sometimes you
can shock an echo out of its loop


18:33.750 --> 18:35.690
If you can talk to the part of
the ghost that's still human,


18:36.120 --> 18:37.510
But usually you have to have


18:37.600 --> 18:38.640
Some kind of connection
to the deceased.


18:39.090 --> 18:40.440
Come on! wake up! be dead!


18:44.370 --> 18:45.770
You guys hear that?
what's that sound?


18:45.940 --> 18:46.590
You guys hear that?


18:48.230 --> 18:49.240
Snap out of it, buddy, huh?


18:50.000 --> 18:51.130
Come on, what are you waiting for?


18:51.170 --> 18:52.370
You're gonzo! you're dead! hey!


18:55.840 --> 18:56.540
Where the hell did it go?


19:08.450 --> 19:09.770
Dude, there's no records
of any of this here.


19:09.870 --> 19:10.680
No one got shot here.


19:10.870 --> 19:12.480
Obviously, no one got run
over by a freaking train.


19:12.730 --> 19:13.310
Stay close.


19:13.470 --> 19:14.250
Did the echoes take Corbett?


19:14.770 --> 19:16.220
Yes. no. I don't know.


19:16.310 --> 19:16.890
We don't know


19:17.000 --> 19:18.340
That's what we're trying
to figure out, okay?


19:18.590 --> 19:19.470
All right, stay close.


19:22.190 --> 19:24.980
Okay, look, death
echoes are ghosts, okay?


19:25.200 --> 19:26.700
Now, ghosts -- they
usually haunt places


19:26.870 --> 19:27.930
Where they lived
or where they died.


19:28.190 --> 19:29.730
Except these mooks
didn't live or die here.


19:30.120 --> 19:30.580
Right.


19:30.800 --> 19:31.570
So, what are they doing here?


19:31.970 --> 19:33.430
Hey, give the lady a cigar.


19:35.060 --> 19:36.480
All right, seriously, does
looking at this nightmare


19:36.640 --> 19:37.800
Through that camera make
you feel better or something?


19:38.130 --> 19:38.740
I mean...


19:39.470 --> 19:40.900
Um...i, uh...


19:42.430 --> 19:44.030
Well, yeah. uh, yeah. I think so.


20:04.310 --> 20:06.280
Freeman daggett,
house's last owner,


20:06.630 --> 20:08.950
Officially commended for
20 years of fine service


20:09.300 --> 20:11.130
At the gamble general hospital.


20:11.340 --> 20:11.890
He's a doctor?


20:13.330 --> 20:13.810
Janitor.


20:15.630 --> 20:16.570
This looks like his den.


20:17.530 --> 20:18.740
When'd you say
he died -- 64?


20:19.000 --> 20:19.850
Yeah, heart attack.


20:20.190 --> 20:21.180
What are these, c-rations?


20:21.910 --> 20:23.180
Yeah, army-issued,
three squares --


20:24.270 --> 20:25.440
Like a lifetime supply.


20:27.690 --> 20:28.600
God, is that all he ate?


20:29.130 --> 20:29.930
One-stop shopping.


20:33.220 --> 20:34.170
Hello. locked.


20:34.330 --> 20:35.500
Oh, come on, guys.
this is ridiculous.


20:35.620 --> 20:37.710
I mean, how the hell is this
supposed to find Corbett, huh?


20:38.280 --> 20:40.230
We should be digging up the
friggin' floorboards right now.


20:43.840 --> 20:45.030
"survival under atomic attack."


20:46.310 --> 20:46.910
An optimist.


21:03.690 --> 21:05.780
Crap. crap.


21:07.040 --> 21:08.600
Taxidermy. okay.


21:09.100 --> 21:10.520
You said Daggett was
a hospital janitor?


21:11.190 --> 21:11.640
Yeah.


21:13.960 --> 21:15.040
Got three toe
tags here --


21:15.630 --> 21:17.120
One, death by gunshots,


21:18.390 --> 21:20.330
Train accident, and suicide.


21:23.970 --> 21:24.460
What?


21:25.870 --> 21:27.920
Well, that explains why all
the death echoes are here.


21:30.830 --> 21:33.870
They're here because
their bodies are here


21:35.150 --> 21:36.430
Somewhere in the house.


21:38.030 --> 21:41.940
Daggett brought the remains
home from the morgue to play.


21:50.860 --> 21:51.320
Yeah.


21:52.150 --> 21:52.740
Wait a minute.


21:55.140 --> 21:55.890
Corbett.


22:03.210 --> 22:04.740
Okay, Maggie.


22:14.350 --> 22:15.220
Closer to the herd, okay?


22:15.420 --> 22:16.820
Maggie? Maggie?


22:17.450 --> 22:18.020
She's fine.


22:18.490 --> 22:20.860
Harry. harry, I got an
8.6 and climbing fast.


22:21.000 --> 22:21.760
Something huge is coming.


22:22.400 --> 22:23.570
Look. something big is coming.


22:24.300 --> 22:25.430
It's past 11, you guys.


22:25.640 --> 22:26.340
What? nobody move!


22:28.000 --> 22:29.150
Hold on. hold on. stay quiet.


22:32.210 --> 22:34.240
It's really cold in here.


22:34.280 --> 22:34.530
Sam?


22:35.380 --> 22:36.090
Some kind of surge.


22:36.900 --> 22:37.400
Sam?


22:40.370 --> 22:40.860
Oh, no.


22:48.840 --> 22:49.590
Sam!


22:55.790 --> 22:56.620
Sammy!


22:56.530 --> 22:57.180
Corbett! sam!


22:57.550 --> 22:58.620
Corbett!


23:00.210 --> 23:00.500
Sam!


23:12.900 --> 23:13.290
God.


23:14.970 --> 23:15.910
God, I am so scared.


23:17.620 --> 23:17.950
I'm so scared.


23:15.910 --> 23:19.010
It's gonna be okay. it's
gonna be okay, Maggie.


23:28.610 --> 23:29.120
Corbett!


23:51.070 --> 23:51.930
My best friend...


23:54.900 --> 23:56.160
And my best sister.


23:56.230 --> 23:57.000
Ed. Ed. harry.


23:57.460 --> 23:58.300
Harry. ed. listen, ed.


23:58.580 --> 23:59.950
Are you banging my sister?


24:02.030 --> 24:02.480
No!


24:03.290 --> 24:03.770
No!


24:05.650 --> 24:06.340
Hold my glasses.


24:07.060 --> 24:07.550
Ed.


24:08.940 --> 24:10.030
Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed!


24:17.710 --> 24:18.580
What the are you doing?!


24:19.120 --> 24:19.680
Cut it out!


24:20.920 --> 24:21.990
We're down by two people.


24:25.100 --> 24:25.700
Sam!


24:28.580 --> 24:29.290
Sammy!


24:30.150 --> 24:30.640
Sorry.


24:33.780 --> 24:34.410
I'm sorry.


24:38.340 --> 24:38.930
Give me my glasses.


24:40.310 --> 24:41.470
Did he knock my
-- my tooth there?


24:42.060 --> 24:42.490
Uh, no.


24:48.840 --> 24:49.310
Thanks, Spruce.


24:49.760 --> 24:50.500
Yeah, it's my fault.


24:51.410 --> 24:52.560
That's real great.
that's nice. thanks.


24:59.010 --> 25:05.680
Corbett.


25:07.940 --> 25:09.000
Corbett. hey.


25:10.320 --> 25:10.950
Corbett, hey.


25:11.420 --> 25:13.610
Hey, you got to keep
listening to my voice, okay?


25:14.490 --> 25:16.960
I'm right here. stay awake.


25:17.620 --> 25:18.360
Don't listen.


25:21.070 --> 25:22.770
It stops hurting, so don't worry.


25:26.830 --> 25:28.550
Corbett, stay with me.


25:29.090 --> 25:30.040
Stay with me, you got it?


25:30.390 --> 25:32.430
I'm right here. hey. stay with me.


25:32.850 --> 25:34.200
Don't. don't.


25:34.770 --> 25:35.280
No.


25:36.790 --> 25:37.290
Corbett!


25:38.250 --> 25:38.750
No!


25:40.600 --> 25:41.110
Corbett!


25:51.530 --> 25:52.930
Corbett! where'd you guys go?


25:53.190 --> 25:53.760
Where are you guys?


25:57.210 --> 25:57.940
Dean, what are you doing?


25:58.060 --> 26:00.080
Okay, so Daggett was
a cold war nut, okay?


26:00.210 --> 26:01.740
He was -- he was an
amateur taxidermist.


26:02.810 --> 26:04.350
He liked to slow
dance with cadavers,


26:04.610 --> 26:05.440
And all he ate were c-rations,


26:05.810 --> 26:07.080
So what the hell
are we looking for?!


26:07.270 --> 26:07.950
Horrible little life.


26:08.280 --> 26:08.920
Yeah, a lonely life.


26:10.620 --> 26:11.470
A cold war life.


26:13.650 --> 26:14.280
He was scared.


26:15.600 --> 26:16.620
He was scared. he was scared.


26:16.740 --> 26:17.400
Scared of what?


26:17.650 --> 26:19.220
What? dean, where are you going?


26:19.410 --> 26:20.410
Wait, don't leave
me in here, you guys.


26:22.330 --> 26:23.080
Get away from me.


26:23.540 --> 26:24.200
This won't hurt.


26:25.450 --> 26:26.040
It's okay.


26:27.020 --> 26:30.830
It's okay. relax. relax.


26:40.120 --> 26:41.190
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
where are you going?


26:41.390 --> 26:42.390
Guys like Daggett back then,


26:42.470 --> 26:43.640
the ones who were really
scared of the russkies --


26:44.170 --> 26:46.730
They built bomb shelters.
I'm guessing he's got one.


26:47.970 --> 26:48.880
I'll bet you it's in the basement.


26:55.360 --> 26:56.760
Um, who closed the door?


26:57.220 --> 26:59.330
It did. it wants to separate us.


26:59.470 --> 27:00.760
Ed! listen to me! what?


27:01.160 --> 27:02.200
There's some salt in my duffle.


27:02.550 --> 27:03.930
Make a circle and get inside.


27:10.200 --> 27:10.740
Inside?


27:11.120 --> 27:12.080
Inside your duffle bag?


27:12.480 --> 27:13.580
In the salt, you idiot!


27:14.130 --> 27:14.840
Oh, okay. yeah. yeah.


27:28.270 --> 27:30.290
Harry, hurry up. get in the
circle. get in the circle.


27:30.650 --> 27:32.000
Come on. come on. quick. quick.


27:33.590 --> 27:36.500
Guys, guys, I don't
want to die, okay,


27:36.620 --> 27:37.330
And I don't want you to die.


27:37.530 --> 27:39.650
Harry, listen -- listen
to me, okay? listen.


27:40.150 --> 27:40.820
If we don't die...


27:42.660 --> 27:45.860
...it's totally okay if
you, uh, do my sister.


27:46.830 --> 27:47.400
Ow. nice.


27:49.880 --> 27:51.840
Oh, no, guys. oh. oh, no.


27:52.110 --> 27:54.370
My camera. get in close.


27:54.560 --> 27:56.680
Why does this keep happening?
why does this keep happening?


27:56.940 --> 27:58.030
Why does this keep happening?


27:58.530 --> 27:59.270
Oh, my god.


28:03.290 --> 28:04.520
Oh, god. oh, god.


28:07.440 --> 28:08.050
It's --
it's Corbett.


28:08.510 --> 28:10.230
Oh. oh, c-Corbett.


28:12.800 --> 28:14.530
Hey, can I ask you something?


28:15.270 --> 28:15.750
What?


28:16.040 --> 28:17.150
Earlier, you
and sam --


28:17.920 --> 28:19.320
He said you had two months left?


28:19.700 --> 28:20.550
Yeah, it's complicated.


28:21.660 --> 28:22.490
A while ago, sam...


28:25.310 --> 28:25.980
No. no. no.


28:26.270 --> 28:28.740
I'm not gonna whine
about my  problems


28:28.840 --> 28:30.820
To some reality show.


28:31.320 --> 28:32.410
I'm gonna do my  job.


28:35.890 --> 28:36.820
Is it cancer?


28:36.950 --> 28:37.390
Shut up.


28:41.030 --> 28:41.620
You hear that?


28:43.400 --> 28:45.020
I've been waiting
for some more friends.


28:45.960 --> 28:46.610
I get lonely.


28:47.650 --> 28:49.270
But you're coming to
my party, aren't you?


28:50.050 --> 28:50.670
Is that music?


28:50.980 --> 28:52.030
Yeah, it's coming
from behind this wall.


29:05.660 --> 29:06.370
Wow, you're strong.


29:07.790 --> 29:09.110
You'll stay a good, long time.


29:51.080 --> 29:51.580
Ed. Ed.


29:51.630 --> 29:52.180
Yeah?


29:53.290 --> 29:55.470
Corbett's a --
he's a death echo.


29:56.410 --> 29:59.320
He's reliving his own murder.


29:58.900 --> 30:00.230
Over and over forever.


30:06.450 --> 30:08.040
What's this Daggett
guy's problem anyway?


30:09.180 --> 30:09.850
Loneliness.


30:10.490 --> 30:11.520
He's never heard of a realdoll?


30:11.800 --> 30:14.100
No, no, no, Daggett
was the norman bates,


30:14.460 --> 30:15.860
Stuff-your-mother
kind of lonely.


30:16.080 --> 30:19.460
That's why he lifted these
bodies from the morgue,


30:19.690 --> 30:20.630
Threw himself a birthday party,


30:21.000 --> 30:22.490
Except they were the
only ones who would come.


30:23.160 --> 30:26.100
Anyway, so, at midnight, he
sealed them   in the bomb shelter


30:26.260 --> 30:28.120
And went upstairs and
o.d.'d on horse tranqs.


30:29.150 --> 30:29.620
How do you know this?


30:30.400 --> 30:31.200
Cause he told me.


30:32.250 --> 30:33.030
Oh. yeah.


30:33.770 --> 30:35.270
Okay, so now that he's dead, what?


30:35.450 --> 30:36.890
Same song, different verse,


30:37.090 --> 30:38.200
Trying to get people
to come to his party?


30:38.420 --> 30:39.800
Pretty much, yeah. stay forever.


30:41.280 --> 30:42.330
Are those real bullets?


30:43.280 --> 30:43.760
It's rock salt.


31:00.220 --> 31:00.800
Oh, no.


31:01.250 --> 31:02.190
Oh, god.


31:06.840 --> 31:07.510
Wait, guys.


31:09.370 --> 31:11.290
Guys, it's --
it's Corbett.


31:12.840 --> 31:14.560
He's -- he's
-- he's trapped.


31:14.650 --> 31:15.490
He's in a lot of pain, you know?


31:15.570 --> 31:16.920
We got to
try and --


31:17.010 --> 31:19.750
We got to try and pull
him out of his loop.


31:22.970 --> 31:23.560
We have to.


31:26.830 --> 31:28.390
Corbett.


31:30.960 --> 31:31.790
Corbett,
it's --


31:33.250 --> 31:33.800
Oh, god.


31:34.230 --> 31:35.100
Don't cross the line of salt.


31:37.680 --> 31:39.300
Corbett, listen to me.


31:40.150 --> 31:41.090
Okay, I'm not gonna hurt you.


31:42.080 --> 31:42.590
Listen.


31:44.370 --> 31:46.520
Listen. oh, god. Corbett.


31:47.890 --> 31:49.110
Oh. oh, god. whoa.


31:50.000 --> 31:51.840
Oh, I can't, okay?


31:53.680 --> 31:54.720
He's not hearing me, okay?


31:55.090 --> 31:56.200
He won't stop dying.


32:02.090 --> 32:03.970
Seriously -- you're
still shooting?


32:04.500 --> 32:05.950
It makes him feel
better. don't ask.


32:12.740 --> 32:13.930
Ah, hell, guys.


32:14.040 --> 32:15.990
Get in your ghost-role
thing. something's coming.


32:17.010 --> 32:17.740
Oh,
my --


32:29.430 --> 32:30.900
I know how we can
get through to him.


32:31.480 --> 32:31.980
How?


32:32.660 --> 32:33.140
Ed...


32:35.890 --> 32:36.930
He had feelings for you.


32:40.300 --> 32:41.580
He wanted you.


32:42.830 --> 32:43.960
Wa-- wanted
me to what?


32:44.120 --> 32:44.600
You know.


32:48.490 --> 32:49.350
And you know what you've got to do.


32:51.920 --> 32:52.630
You can do it, Ed.


32:54.490 --> 32:55.880
You've always been the
brave one. yes, you can.


32:56.340 --> 32:58.300
You make us brave
-- Maggie, right?


32:58.490 --> 33:00.100
Yeah.


33:00.860 --> 33:01.410
Ed...


33:02.950 --> 33:05.210
You got to go be gay for
that poor, dead intern.


33:05.740 --> 33:07.270
You got to send him into the light.


33:26.780 --> 33:27.380
Corbett.


33:28.450 --> 33:29.190
Maggie, no. no.


33:29.670 --> 33:30.530
It's okay.


33:32.040 --> 33:32.810
Corbett, look.


33:33.450 --> 33:35.490
Hey, it's just Ed,
buddy. it's just me.


33:36.530 --> 33:39.080
Hey, hey, Corbett, listen
to me. listen to me.


33:39.440 --> 33:40.760
I --
we...


33:44.300 --> 33:44.880
Okay.


33:45.850 --> 33:46.520
You meant...


33:48.800 --> 33:50.240
Corbett, you meant
a lot to the team.


33:54.230 --> 33:54.840
You meant...


33:57.290 --> 33:58.320
You meant a lot to me.


33:59.000 --> 34:00.690
You know, never back down...


34:02.620 --> 34:04.570
Never say a bad word, okay?


34:04.720 --> 34:07.930
I remember that, Corbett.
i-i remember that.


34:08.080 --> 34:09.690
I remember because
I love you, Corbett.


34:11.040 --> 34:13.260
I really, truly love you.


34:17.670 --> 34:19.240
Do you remember that? do you?


34:21.140 --> 34:22.610
Hey. Ed?


34:22.980 --> 34:23.520
Yeah.


34:25.270 --> 34:26.360
Yeah, Corbett, it's...


34:29.050 --> 34:30.130
Corbett, yeah, it's me.


34:31.710 --> 34:33.150
It's me. look at me.


34:36.300 --> 34:38.960
You got to help us, man.
you have to help us, Corbett.


34:39.290 --> 34:40.250
Please. please.


34:41.380 --> 34:42.530
Please help us right now.


34:43.950 --> 34:44.690
Take it easy. you all right?


34:46.090 --> 34:47.540
Uh, guys...


34:53.240 --> 34:54.850
This is bad
-- very bad.


35:02.040 --> 35:03.290
Corbett?


35:14.060 --> 35:14.630
You all right, dude?


35:17.340 --> 35:17.840
You all right?


35:24.690 --> 35:25.420
God.


35:45.950 --> 35:50.190
Leap year, february
29th, the Morton house.


35:50.480 --> 35:51.360
A tragic
day --


35:52.250 --> 35:55.200
A day of souls bound in torment,


35:55.580 --> 35:58.470
Of lives held in cruel balance.


35:59.770 --> 36:00.760
But the
Ghostfacers --


36:00.880 --> 36:02.170
They did the best that they could.


36:03.610 --> 36:06.200
We lost a beloved friend,


36:07.490 --> 36:10.470
But we gained new allies.


36:10.860 --> 36:11.920
We know
this much --


36:12.870 --> 36:15.230
That every day, including today,


36:15.970 --> 36:16.920
Is a new beginning.


36:18.600 --> 36:20.800
We learned more than we can say


36:21.030 --> 36:22.850
In the brutal feat
of the morton house.


36:24.370 --> 36:27.730
The Ghostfacers were
forced to face something


36:28.460 --> 36:31.190
Far more scary than ghosts.


36:32.700 --> 36:34.150
They were forced
to face themselves.


36:36.270 --> 36:37.690
War changes man.


36:39.000 --> 36:40.120
And Maggie.


36:41.790 --> 36:44.090
War changes man...


36:45.740 --> 36:46.500
And one woman.


36:49.690 --> 36:50.850
You know, Corbett, we just...


36:52.770 --> 36:54.370
Oh, gosh, we just like to think


36:54.490 --> 36:55.950
That you're out there
watching over us.


36:57.330 --> 36:57.750
As far as we're concerned,


36:58.730 --> 36:59.950
You're not an intern anymore.


37:01.430 --> 37:04.300
You have more than earned
full Ghostfacer status.


37:05.940 --> 37:07.280
Plus, it'd be cool to
have a ghost on the team.


37:07.440 --> 37:07.880
Yeah.


37:08.750 --> 37:09.540
You know, and here we were,


37:09.660 --> 37:12.310
Thinking that, you know,
we were teaching you,


37:12.350 --> 37:14.250
And all this time,


37:14.400 --> 37:15.530
You were teaching us...


37:16.990 --> 37:18.440
About heart,


37:19.110 --> 37:21.990
About dedication, and...


37:24.120 --> 37:28.800
About how gay love can pierce
through the veil of death


37:29.850 --> 37:30.810
And save the day.


37:33.480 --> 37:35.160
Thank you, alan j. Corbett.


37:36.460 --> 37:39.550
Go well into that
starry night, young turk.


37:42.080 --> 37:42.590
Go well.


37:51.260 --> 37:52.340
Come on, Spruce.


37:52.550 --> 37:54.310
I got to get all
this stuff packed up.


37:54.670 --> 37:55.970
So? pack and talk.


37:56.690 --> 37:57.530
I don't know what to say.


37:57.970 --> 37:58.770
Say what comes to mind.


38:00.080 --> 38:01.960
This is one of our
confessional moments, Corbett,


38:02.100 --> 38:02.900
So confess.


38:03.820 --> 38:05.630
What do you think was
gonna happen tonight?


38:05.730 --> 38:08.020
What do you think's gonna
happen tonight on this trip?


38:10.100 --> 38:12.450
I think tonight
-- I really do --


38:13.330 --> 38:14.630
I think all our dreams
are gonna come true.


38:17.590 --> 38:18.340
Does that sound stupid?


38:19.500 --> 38:20.290
Kind of does, yeah.


38:43.630 --> 38:44.720
So, guys, what do you think?


38:46.930 --> 38:47.490
You all right?


38:48.840 --> 38:50.170
You know, I kind of
think it was half awesome.


38:50.960 --> 38:53.290
Half awesome -- that's
full-on good, right?


38:54.590 --> 38:55.010
Yeah.


38:55.210 --> 38:56.950
I mean, it's bizarre
how y'all are able to --


38:57.360 --> 39:00.020
To honor Corbett's memory while
grossly exploiting the manner of his


39:00.160 --> 39:00.980
death.


39:01.250 --> 39:01.710
Well done.


39:02.150 --> 39:04.150
Yeah, that's a real tight
rope you guys are walking.


39:04.380 --> 39:05.910
Yeah. all right, guys.


39:08.500 --> 39:11.090
No, that's reality, man. yeah.


39:11.330 --> 39:12.830
Corbett gave his life
searching for the truth,


39:13.130 --> 39:16.270
And it is our job over here
to share it with the world.


39:17.250 --> 39:19.480
Right. well, um,
our experience --


39:19.850 --> 39:21.490
You know what you get when
you show the world the truth?


39:21.810 --> 39:24.000
A straightjacket or
a punch in the face --


39:24.110 --> 39:25.110
Sometimes both. right.


39:25.330 --> 39:27.840
Oh, come on, guys,
don't be 'facer haters


39:28.000 --> 39:30.230
Because we happen to have gotten
the footage of the century.


39:30.790 --> 39:31.280
Oh, yeah.


39:34.900 --> 39:35.890
You got us there. yeah.


39:36.080 --> 39:37.970
Yeah, well, we'll
see you guys around.


39:49.270 --> 39:49.900
Dicks.


39:51.180 --> 39:51.910
Oh, yeah.


39:52.010 --> 39:52.630
Yeah. yep.


39:53.170 --> 39:54.440
Start laying off some dvds.


39:54.530 --> 39:56.380
Sounds like a good idea, Spruce.


39:57.370 --> 39:59.910
You know, guys, I think we're gonna
need a bigger office here, you know,


39:59.960 --> 40:00.870
Cause we're gonna go national,


40:01.120 --> 40:03.300
And then it's gonna go
international, and then --


40:03.690 --> 40:05.340
Hey, menudo left
their dance bag behind.


40:07.560 --> 40:08.750
What's inside, huh?


40:13.040 --> 40:13.940
What the hell is this?


40:14.630 --> 40:18.180
Uh, I seem to be having some
technical difficulty over here.


40:19.880 --> 40:20.990
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.


40:21.160 --> 40:22.250
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.


40:22.570 --> 40:23.590
Wait! wait! wait! wait! wait!


40:23.780 --> 40:25.150
"no operating system
found"? wait a minute.


40:27.840 --> 40:28.320
We clean?


40:28.740 --> 40:29.350



40:36.190 --> 40:38.010
Electromagnet wiped out every
tape and hard drive they have.


40:38.450 --> 40:39.960
World just isn't ready
for the Ghostfacers.


40:40.640 --> 40:42.720
That's too bad. I
kind of liked the show.


40:45.130 --> 40:45.760
Had its moments.
