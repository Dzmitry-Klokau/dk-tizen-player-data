00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.530
Merry christmas, grandpa.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.960
Oh, merry christmas to you, stevie.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.900
Did you bring me any presents?

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.760
Now, why would i want to do that?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.960
'Cause it's christmas.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Oh, i thought santa claus

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.400
Brought the presents at christmas.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.930
You have been a good boy
this year, haven't you?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960
I have, i swear.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.300
Well, then, who
knows?Maybe he'll come.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.860
Santa!

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.160
Reindeer.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.130
Santa?

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.500
Um, my daughter and
i were in our beds.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.460
Mike was downstairs
decorating the tree.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.830
I heard a thump on the roof,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.100
And then i-I heard mike scream,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.400
And now i'm talking to the fbi.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.530
And you didn't see any of it?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.930
No, he was... he was just gone.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.000
The doors were locked?There
was no forced entry?

00:02:45.035 --> 00:02:46.000
That's right.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.530
Does anybody else
have a key?My parents.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.200
Where do they live?

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.660
Florida.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.960
Thanks for letting me have
a look around, mrs. Walsh.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.360
I think we, uh, got just
about everything we need.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.130
We're all set.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.630
We'll be in touch.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.260
Agents...

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.360
T
- The police said my husband might have been kidnapped.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.730
Could be.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.500
Then why haven't
the kidnappers called

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.730
O- Or - Or
demanded a ransom?

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.900
It's three days till christmas.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.530
What am i supposed
to tell our daughter?

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.460
We're very sorry.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.360
Find anything?

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.300
Stockings, mistletoe... this.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.260
A tooth?Where was this?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.860
In the chimney.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.130
No way a man fits up a
chimney. It's too narrow.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.730
No way he fits up in one piece.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.860
All right, so, if dad
went up the chimney -

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.060
We need to find out what
dragged him up there.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.960
So, was i right?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.530
Is it the serial-Killing
chimney sweep?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.700
Yep.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.300
It's, uh, it's
actually dick van dyke.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.230
Who?

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.030
"Mary poppins. "Who's that?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.430
Oh, come on -Never mind.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.360
It turns out that walsh
is the second guy in town

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.300
Grabbed out of his
house this month.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.530
Oh, yeah?Yeah.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.560
The other guy get dragged
up the chimney, too?

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.800
Don't know. Witnesses said
they heard a thump on the roof.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.560
So, what the hell do you
think we're dealing with?

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.860
Actually, i have an idea. Yeah?

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.560
It's, uh, it's gonna sound crazy.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.960
What could you possibly
say that sounds crazy to me?

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.730
Evil santa.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.630
Yeah, that's crazy.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.630
Yeah... i mean, i'm just saying

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.160
That there's some version of
the anti-Claus in every culture.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.230
You got belsnickel,
krampus, black peter.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.960
Whatever you want to call
it, there's all sorts of lore.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.230
Saying what?

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.330
Saying back in the day,
santa's brother went rogue,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.930
And now he shows up
around christmastime.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.930
Instead of bringing presents,
he punishes the wicked.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.330
By hauling their ass up chimneys?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.830
For starters, yeah.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.800
So, this is your theory,
huh? Santa's shady brother?

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.760
Well, i'm just saying,
that's what the lore says.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.630
Santa doesn't have a
brother. There is no santa.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.000
Yeah, i know.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.260
You're the one who told
me that in the first place

00:05:02.295 --> 00:05:03.260
Remember?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.730
Yeah, you know
what?I could be wrong.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.100
I...

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.460
...got to be wrong.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.100
Maybe, maybe not.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.030
What?

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.960
I did a little digging
- Turns out both victims

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Visited the same place
before they got snatched.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.230
Where?

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.300
It does kind of lend credence
to the theory, don't it?

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.400
Yeah, but anti-Claus?

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.100
Couldn't be.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.630
It's a christmas miracle.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.130
Hey, speaking of, we
should have one this year.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.330
Have one what?A christmas.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.800
No, thanks.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.260
No, we'll get a tree,
a little boston market -

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.000
Just like when we were little.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.730
Dean, those weren't exactly
hallmark memories for me.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.860
What are you talking about?

00:05:57.895 --> 00:05:58.960
We had some great christmases.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.500
Whose childhood are
you talking about?

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.300
Oh, come on, sam.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.100
No, just... no.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.660
All right, grinch.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.900
What is that?

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.560
A present for dad.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.500
Yeah, right.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.660
Where'd you get
the money -Steal it?

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.160
No. Uncle bobby gave
it to me to give to him.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.730
Said it was real special.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.000
What is it?

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.360
A pony.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.700
Very funny.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.360
Dad's gonna be here, right?

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.800
He'll be here.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.530
It's christmas.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.060
He knows.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.060
And he'll be here -Promise.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.400
Where is he, anyway?

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.460
On business.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.760
What kind of business?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.460
You know that.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.130
He sells stuff.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.630
What kind of stuff?Stuff.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.430
Nobody ever tells me anything.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.430
Then quit asking.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.960
Is dad a spy?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.060
Mm-Hmm. He's james bond.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.160
Why do we move around so much?

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.130
'Cause everywhere we go,
they get sick of your face.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.630
I'm old enough, dean.
You can tell me the truth.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.330
You don't want to know
the truth. Believe me.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.260
Is that why we never
talk about... mom?

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.430
Shut up!

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.400
Don't you ever talk about mom
- Ever!

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.730
Wait. Where are you going?

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.730
Out.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.530
You'd think with the 10 bucks
it costs to get into this place,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.900
Santa could scrounge
up a little snow.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.830
What?

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.530
Nothing. What are we
looking for, again?

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.560
Lore says that the anti-Claus

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.900
Will walk with a limp
and smell like sweets.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.230
Great. So we're looking
for a pimp santa.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.600
Why the sweets?

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.360
Think about it, dean.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.525
If you smell like candy

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.260
The kids will come
closer, you know?

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.100
That's creepy.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.560
How does this thing know

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.000
Who's been naughty
and who's been nice?

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.760
I don't know.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.460
So, ronny, come
sit on santa's knee.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.760
Ah, there you go.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.030
You been a good boy this year?Yeah

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.530
Good.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.330
Santa's got a special gift for you

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.300
Maybe we do

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.000
Welcome to santa's court.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.530
Can i escort your child to santa?

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.100
N
- No. No.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.930
Uh, but, actually,
my brother here -

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.330
It's been a lifelong dream of his.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.560
Uh, sorry. No kids over... 12.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.200
No, he's just kidding. We
only came here to watch.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.560
I- I didn't mean that
we came here to w-Y

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.160
Thanks a lot, dean.
Thanks for that.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.830
Check it out.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.630
Are you seeing this?

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.730
A lot of people walk
with limps, right?

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.300
Tell me you didn't smell
that. That was candy, man.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.600
That was ripple
- I think. Had to be.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.030
Maybe. We willing
to take that chance?

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.530
What time is it?

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.230
Same as the last time you asked.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.130
Here.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.760
Caffeinate.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.760
Wonderful.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.460
Hey, sam...

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.300
Yeah?

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.830
Why are you the boy
that hates christmas?

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.760
Dean... i mean, i admit it -

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.330
We had a few bumpy holidays
when we were kids. "Bumpy"?

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.930
That was then. We'll
do it right this year.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.260
Look, dean, if you
want to have christmas

00:10:37.295 --> 00:10:38.860
Knock yourself out.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.560
Just don't involve me.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.100
Oh, yeah, that'd be great -

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.430
Me and myself making
cranberry molds.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.600
What's up with saint nicotine?

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.300
What?

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.560
Nothing.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.900
It's just that,
uh... well, you know,

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.160
Mr. Gung ho christmas might
have to blow away santa.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.660
What the hell are you doing here?

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.200
I'm really not interested, okay?

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.330
Jingle my bells...

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.230
S
- Silent night

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.830
Holy...

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.730
...night... night

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.700
* all is well * all is well

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.830
* all is dry

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.000
* bright

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.160
* 'round and 'round

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.260
* the table...

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.360
Santa, you're early!

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.300
So, that's how your son
described the attack?

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.200
"Santa took daddy up the chimney"?

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.130
That's what he says, yes.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.500
And where were you?

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:18.730
I was asleep.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.000
And all of a sudden...

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.230
...i was being dragged
out of bed, screaming.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.300
Did you see the attacker?

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.430
It was dark, and he hit me.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.700
He knocked me out.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.260
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.400
Yeah... um, mrs. Caldwell,

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.730
Where did you get that
wreath above the fireplace?

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.160
Excuse me?

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.730
Just curious, you know.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:58.830
Wreaths, huh?

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.730
Sure you didn't want to
ask her about her shoes?

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.630
I saw some nice
handbags in the foyer.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.930
We've seen that
wreath before, dean.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.000
Where?

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.630
The walshes'.Yesterday.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.100
I know, i was just testing you.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.400
Yeah. All right. Well,
keep looking, would you?

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.960
Thanks, bobby.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.430
What did bobby say?

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.400
Uh, that we're morons.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.830
He also said

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.500
That it was probably
meadowsweet in those wreaths.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.600
Wow! Amazing.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.430
What the hell is meadowsweet?

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.830
It's pretty rare,

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.800
And it's probably the most
powerful plant in pagan lore.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.960
Pagan lore? Yeah.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.660
See, they used meadowsweet
for human sacrifices.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.130
It was kind of like
a... chum for their gods.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.430
Gods were drawn to
it, and they'd stop by

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.200
And snack on whatever
was the nearest human.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.330
Why would somebody be using
that for christmas wreaths?

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.300
It's not as crazy
as it sounds, dean.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.030
I mean, pretty much every
christmas tradition is pagan.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.960
Christmas is jesus' birthday.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.430
No, jesus' birthday was
probably in the fall.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.800
It was actually the
winter solstice festival

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.130
That was co-Opted by the
church and renamed "christmas. "

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.330
But the yule log, the
tree, even santa's red suit

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.960
That's all remnants
of pagan worship.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.430
How do you know that?

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.900
What are you gonna tell me next?

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.660
Easter bunny's jewish?

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.730
So, you think we're
dealing with a pagan god?

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.860
Yeah, probably hold nickar,
god of the winter solstice.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.030
And all these martha
stewart wannabes,

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.830
Buying these fancy wreaths...

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.600
It's pretty much like putting
a neon sign on your front door

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.700
Saying, "come kill us. "

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.300
Great.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.400
When you sacrifice to hold nickar,

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.400
Guess what he gives you in return.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.800
Lap dances, hopefully.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.130
Mild weather.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.460
Like no snow in the
middle of december

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.260
In the middle of
michigan. For instance.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.730
Do we know how to kill it yet?

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.360
No, bobby's working
on that right now.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.700
We got to figure out where
they're selling those wreaths.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.300
You think they're
selling them on purpose?

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.500
Feeding the victims to this thing?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.400
Let's find out.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.360
Help you boys?

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.830
Uh, hope so.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.900
Uh, we were playing jenga with
the walshes the other night,

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.800
And he hasn't shut up since
about this christmas wreath.

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:19.800
I don't know. You tell him.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.660
Sure.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.900
It was yummy.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.360
I sell a lot of wreaths, guys.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.430
Right, right, but you see,

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.400
This one would have
been really special.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:39.560
It had, uh, it had, uh, green
leaves, um, white buds on it.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.930
It might have been made
of, uh, meadowsweet?

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.530
Well... aren't you a fussy one?

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.260
He is.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.160
Anyway, i know the one
you're talking about.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.600
I'm all out.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.930
Seems like this meadowsweet
stuff's rare and expensive.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.400
Why make wreaths out of it?

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.100
Beats me. I didn't make them.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.300
Who did?

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.660
Madge carrigan a local lady.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.460
Said the wreaths were so
special, she gave them for free.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.430
She didn't charge you? Nope.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.930
Did you sell them for free?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.160
Hell, no. It's christmas.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.000
People pay a buttload
for this crap.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.100
That's the spirit.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.200
How much do you think a
meadowsweet wreath would cost?

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.130
A couple hundred dollars, at least.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.230
This lady's giving
them away for free?

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.930
What do you think about that?

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.730
Well, sounds pretty suspicious.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.230
Remember that wreath dad
brought home that one year?

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.360
Do you mean the one he stole
from, like, a liquor store?

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.800
Yeah, it was a bunch
of empty beer cans.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.360
That thing was great.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.530
I bet if i looked
around hard enough,

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.160
I could probably
find one just like it.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.530
All right...

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.400
Dude...

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.500
What's going on with you? What?

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.000
I mean, since when are you
bing crosby all of a sudden?

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.200
Why do you want to
do christmas so bad?

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.000
Why are you so against it?

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.800
Were your childhood
memories that traumatic?

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.300
No, that has nothing to do with it.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.130
Then what?

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.960
I mean, i-I just
- I don't get it.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.160
You haven't talked
about christmas in years.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.660
Well, yeah.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.600
This is my last year.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.800
I know.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.300
That's why i can't.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.500
What do you mean?

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.730
I mean i can't just sit around,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.960
Drinking eggnog,
pretending everything's okay

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.700
When i know next
christmas you'll be dead.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.960
I just can't.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.430
Thought you went out.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.800
Yeah. To get you dinner.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.060
Don't forget your vegetables.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.360
I know why you keep a
gun under your pillow.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.230
No, you don't. Stay
out of my stuff.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.960
And i know why we lay
salt down everywhere we go.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.360
No, you don't. Shut up.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.560
Where'd you get that? That's dad's!

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.800
He's gonna kick your
ass for reading that.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.260
Are monsters real?

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.260
What?You're crazy.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.260
Tell me.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.200
I swear, if you ever tell
dad i told you any of this,

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.760
I will end you.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.400
Promise.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.200
Well, the first
thing you have to know

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.200
Is we have the coolest
dad in the world.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.930
He's a superhero.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.200
He is? Yeah.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.760
Monsters are real.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.030
Dad fights them.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.830
He's fighting them right now.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.760
But dad said the monsters
under my bed weren't real.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.060
That's 'cause he had
already checked under there.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.600
But, yeah, they're real.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.200
Almost everything's real.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.800
Is santa real?

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.100
No.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.560
If monsters are real,
then they could get us.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.300
They could get me. Dad's
not gonna let them get you.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.630
But what if they get him?

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.060
They aren't gonna get dad.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.000
Dad's, like, the best.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.100
I read in dad's book
that they got mom.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.560
It's complicated, sam.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.400
If they got mom, they can get dad.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.730
And if they get
dad, they can get us.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.830
It's not like that.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.560
Okay, dad's fine.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.300
We're fine.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.830
Trust me.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.500
You okay?

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.830
Yeah.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.360
Hey, dad's gonna be
here for christmas...

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.000
Just like he always is.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.530
I just want to go to sleep, okay?

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.560
Yeah, okay.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.000
It'll all be better
when you wake up.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.160
You'll see.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.230
Promise.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.830
This is where mrs.
Wreath lives, huh?

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.330
Can't you just feel
the evil pagan vibe?

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.730
Yes?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.560
Please tell me you're the madge carrigan
who makes the meadowsweet wreaths.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.130
Why, yes, i am.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.260
Ha! Bingo.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.200
Well, we were just
admiring your wreaths

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.900
In mr. Sylar's place the other day.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.130
You were?

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.800
Well, isn't that meadowsweet

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.760
Just the finest-Smelling
thing you ever smelled?

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.100
It sure is.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.560
But the problem is, is all
your wreaths had sold out

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.360
Before we got the chance
to buy one. Oh, fudge!

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.730
You wouldn't have another one
that we could buy from you?

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.060
No, i'm afraid those were the
only ones i had for this season.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.430
Tell me something -

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.860
Why did you decide to make
them out of meadowsweet?

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.930
Why, the smell, of course!

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.200
I don't think i've ever
smelled anything finer.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.900
Yeah, um, you mentioned that.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.600
What's going on, honey?

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.900
Well, just some nice boys
asking about my wreaths, dear.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.100
Oh, the wreaths are
fine. Fine wreaths.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.300
Oh, care for some peanut brittle?

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.730
We're okay.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.930
I knew it!

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.100
Something was way
off with those two.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.230
What'd you find?

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.630
The carrigans lived
in seattle last year,

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.430
Where two abductions took
place right around christmas.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.300
They moved here in january.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.960
All that christmas crap in their
house wasn't boughs of holly.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.460
It was vervain and mint.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.700
Pagan stuff? Serious pagan stuff.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.860
So, what, ozzie and harriet
are keeping a pagan god

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.300
Hidden underneath their
plastic-Covered couch?

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.830
I don't know. We got
to check them out.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.330
So, what about bobby?

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.330
He's sure evergreen stakes
will kill this thing, right?

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.760
Yeah, he's sure.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.460
See? Plastic.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.630
Hey, dean.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.430
Sam!

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:03.230
Gosh, i wish you boys
hadn't come down here.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.760
Dean?

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.130
You okay?

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.860
Yeah, i think so.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.130
So, i guess we're dealing
with mr. And mrs. God.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.200
Nice to know.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.200
Ooh, and here we
thought you two lazybones

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:42.360
Were gonna sleep straight
through all the fun stuff.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.800
Miss all this? Nah, we're partyers.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.630
Isn't he a kick in
the pants, honey?

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.860
You're hunters is what you are.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.360
And you're pagan gods.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.130
So, why don't we just call it
even and go our separate ways?

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.860
So you can bring more
hunters and kill us?

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.800
I don't think so!

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:59.030
You should have thought about
that before snacking on humans.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.760
Oh, now, don't get all wet.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.260
Oh, why, we used to take over
a hundred tributes a year.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.760
And that's a fact.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.860
Now what do we take?
What, two? Three?

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.860
Hardy boys here make five.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.730
Now, that's not so bad, is it?

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.230
You say it like that, you
guys are the cunninghams.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.360
You, mister, better
show us a little respect.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.230
Or what? You'll eat us?

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.260
Not so fast.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.900
There's rituals to
be followed first.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.160
Oh, we're just
sticklers for ritual.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.160
And you know what kicks
off the whole shebang?

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.060
Let me guess -Meadowsweet.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.230
Oh, shucks -You're
all out of wreaths.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.560
I guess we'll just have to
cancel the sacrifice, huh?

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.730
Oh, don't be such a gloomy gus.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.730
There.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.630
Don't they just look darling?

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.160
Good enough to eat.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.700
All righty-Roo. Step number two.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.130
Sammy.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:02.960
Sammy!

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.260
D
- Don't!

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.400
Leave him alone,
you son of a bitch!

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.800
Hear how they talk to us? To gods?

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.960
Listen, pal, back in the day,
we were worshiped by millions.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.430
Times have changed!
Tell me about it.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.330
All of a sudden, this jesus character
is the hot new thing in town.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.630
All of a sudden, our altars
are being burned down,

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.900
And we're being hunted
down like common monsters.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:28.400
But did we say a peep?
Oh, no, no, no, we did not.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.430
Two millennium.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:34.460
We kept a low profile.
We got jobs, a mortgage.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.060
We -What was that word, dear?

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.460
We assimilated.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.530
Yeah, we assimilated.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.200
Why, we play bridge on
tuesdays and fridays.

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.960
We're just like everybody else.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.100
You're not blending in as
smooth as you think, lady.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:49.200
This might pinch a bit, dear.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.030
You bitch!

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.730
Oh, my goodness me!

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.260
Somebody owes a nickel
to the swear jar.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.160
Oh, do you know what i say
when i feel like swearing?

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.800
"Fudge. "

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.030
I'll try and remember that!

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.030
You boys have no idea
how lucky you are.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.730
There was a time when
kids came from miles around

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.600
Just to be sitting where you are.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.700
What do you think
you're doing with those?

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.500
You fudging touch me again,
i'll fudging kill you!

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.000
Very good.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.160
No, don't.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.260
Oh, we've got a winner!

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.160
What else, dear?

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.660
Well, let's see. Uh,
fingernail, blood...

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.500
I forgot the tooth!

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.760
Oh, dear!

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.660
Merry christmas, sam.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.830
Open wide... and say, "ahh. "

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.530
Somebody gonna get that?

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.060
You should get that.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.660
Come on.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.760
Merry christmas!

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.660
I told you i smelled fruitcake.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.230
You shouldn't have.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.800
Oh, bite your tongue.
It's my pleasure.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.060
It looks scrumptious!

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.200
Neal and i are going
caroling. You care to join?

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:42.430
You know, we would...

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.400
It's my back
- Darn thing's giving me fits.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.060
Oh, well, that's a shame.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.230
- Oh, well. Merry christmas.
- And to you, too, dear.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.200
- Hey, are we still on for bridge tomorrow?
- With bells on!

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.330
- Yes! Okay,
bye. -Bye-Bye.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.100
Now, where were we?

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.930
What do we do now?!

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.230
The evergreen stake's
in the basement!

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.260
Well, we need more evergreen, dean!

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.930
I think i just found us some more.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.700
Help me get this.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:32.760
Go!

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.900
Come on!

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.830
You little thing...

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.830
I loved that tree.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.400
Madge!

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.400
Merry christmas.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:13.000
Sam, wake up.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.000
Dad was here. Look what he brought.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.060
Dad was here?

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.030
Yeah. Look at this.
We made a killing.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.200
Why didn't he try to wake me up?

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.500
He tried to, like a thousand times.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.600
He did?

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:35.330
Yeah. Did i tell you he would
give us christmas or what?

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:37.860
Go on, dive in.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.330
What is it?

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.400
Sapphire barbie?

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.600
Dad probably thinks you're a girl.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:00.660
Shut up.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.130
Open that one.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.630
Dad never showed, did he?

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.360
Yeah, he did, i swear.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.430
Dean... where'd you
get all this stuff?

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.300
Nice house up the block.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.530
I swear i didn't know
they were chick presents.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.960
Look, i'm sure dad would
have been here if he could.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.800
If he's alive.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:37.960
Don't say that.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.500
Of course he's alive.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.200
He's dad.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.160
Here. Take this.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.630
No. No, that's for dad.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.500
Dad lied to me.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:59.330
I want you to have it.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.160
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.130
Thank you, sam. I-I love it.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.500
Hey. You get the beer?

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.500
What's all this?

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:52.530
What do you think it is? It's
- It's christmas.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.200
What made you change your mind?

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.730
Here, uh...

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.260
Try the eggnog.

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.060
Let me know if it
needs some more kick.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.360
No, we're good.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.530
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.700
Good. Well, uh, have a seat.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:23.430
Let's do christmas
stuff or whatever.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.330
All right, first thing's first.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.830
Merry christmas, sam.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.600
- Where'd you get these?
- Someplace special.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.430
The gas mart down the street.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.100
Open them up.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:48.260
Well, great minds
think alike, dean.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.260
Really?

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.960
There you go.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Come on!

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.760
Skin mags!

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.760
And...

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.060
Shaving cream.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.130
You like?

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.130
Yeah. Yeah.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.300
Look at this

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:17.160
Fuel for me and fuel for my baby.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.130
These are awesome. Thanks.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.930
Good.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.300
Merry christmas, bro.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.360
Here, merry christmas.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.100
Do you feel like watching the game?

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:07.430
Absolutely.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.060
All right.
