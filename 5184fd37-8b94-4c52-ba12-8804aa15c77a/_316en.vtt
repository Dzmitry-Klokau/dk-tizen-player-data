WEBVTT

00:00:02.165 --> 00:00:03.983
The Road So Far

00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:20.917
Let me guess, you are oferring your own soul?

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:22.544
All you got to do is bringing Sam back

00:00:22.544 --> 00:00:24.458
- How long have you get
- one year

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.180
Let Dean out of this deal right now

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.614
I got a boss like everybody

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:28.762
Who holds the contract?

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.389
I can't tell you.

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:33.642
There is a new leader rising in the west

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.269
doesn't like you very much.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.896
Her name is Lilith

00:00:37.278 --> 00:00:39.000
- I know about your deal, Dean.
- Who told you that?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.584
The demon that holds it.
She holds mine, too.

00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:44.167
- She?
- Her name's Lilith.

00:00:47.036 --> 00:00:47.994
So, this is Ruby, huh?

00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:48.855
She's a demon, Sam.

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.769
They want us dead.
We want them dead.

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.395
what kind of blade could kill a demon?

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:54.022
yesterday, i'd have said
There was no such thing.

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:55.935
Yellow eyes had some
Pretty big plans for you, Sam.

00:00:55.935 --> 00:00:59.093
You're specialn that
E.s.p.-vision kind of way.

00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:00.814
No, that stuff's
Not happening anymore.

00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:03.686
Black dogs? They're seeing
Hellhounds -- demonic pit bulls.

00:01:08.564 --> 00:01:11.434
- There's no way of saving me, is there?
- No.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.113
I don't want to die.I don't wanna go to hell.

00:01:14.113 --> 00:01:16.218
We will find a way to save you.

00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:32.389
You're gonna die!
This is what you're gonna become!

00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:35.451
now

00:02:29.508 --> 00:02:30.847
(hellhounds)

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.674
Dig up anything good?

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.119
No. Nothing good.

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:39.840
Well, Bobby has, finally.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.084
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:43.285
A way to find Lilith.

00:02:43.572 --> 00:02:47.208
Wow. With just, uh, 30 hours to go.

00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:50.938
Hey, why don't we just make
A t.j. Run, you know?

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:53.234
Some seÑOritas, cervezas?

00:02:53.234 --> 00:02:56.106
We could -- what's spanish
For "donkey show"?

00:02:57.542 --> 00:03:00.411
So, if we do save you...

00:03:00.411 --> 00:03:02.899
Let's never do that.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.587
Hey, hey, Dean...

00:03:10.458 --> 00:03:13.902
Look, we're cuttinit cse,I know.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:16.580
But we are gonna get this done.

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:19.450
I don't care What it take

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.034
You are not gonna go to hell.

00:03:22.512 --> 00:03:24.618
I'm not gonna let you.

00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:28.732
I swear.

00:03:28.732 --> 00:03:31.602
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:42.509
Yeah, okay.

00:03:55.138 --> 00:03:56.956
So, you got a name?

00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:58.965
That's the whole kit and caboodle.

00:03:58.965 --> 00:04:01.357
With the right name,The right ritual,

00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:02.888
Ain't nothing You can't suss out.

00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:05.281
Like the town Lilith in?

00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:08.151
When I get it done. We will know it straight.

00:04:12.264 --> 00:04:15.135
#!@#%!@......

00:04:24.607 --> 00:04:26.617
New Harmony, Indiana.

00:04:26.617 --> 00:04:28.147
And we have a winner.

00:04:28.147 --> 00:04:29.487
All right. Let's go

00:04:29.487 --> 00:04:30.826
whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold on.

00:04:30.826 --> 00:04:32.548
Just holster it up, There, tex.

00:04:32.548 --> 00:04:33.792
- What's the problem?
- "what's the problem"?

00:04:33.792 --> 00:04:35.419
Come on, where do i begin?

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.906
I mean, first of all,We don't even know
if Lilith actually holds my deal.

00:04:37.906 --> 00:04:40.107
We are going off Ofela's intel?

00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:42.403
Now, when that bit
The air comes out crooked, okay

00:04:42.403 --> 00:04:45.655
Second, even if we could
Get to Lilith, we have to gank her.

00:04:45.655 --> 00:04:48.527
And third, isn't this the same Lilith
that wants your giayoon a pike?

00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:49.675
Should i continue?

00:04:49.675 --> 00:04:51.493
Ain't you just bringing down the room?

00:04:51.493 --> 00:04:52.544
- Well, it's a gift.
- I'm sorry.

00:04:52.544 --> 00:04:53.885
So, then, what are we
Supposed to do, Dean?

00:04:53.885 --> 00:04:55.415
Well, just 'cause i got to die
Doesn't mean you have to, okay?

00:04:55.415 --> 00:04:57.233
Either we go in smart
Or we don't go in at all.

00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:59.051
Okay, fine.That's the case,
I have the answer.

00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:00.007
- You do?
- Yeah.

00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:01.730
A surefire way to confirm it's Lilith

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.600
And a way to get us
A bona fide demon-killing ginsu.

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:06.801
Damn it, Sam, no.

00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:08.427
We are so past arguing.

00:05:08.427 --> 00:05:09.766
Dean, i am summoning Ruby.

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:11.489
The hell you are!
We got enough problems as it is.

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:15.221
Exactly. And we got no time
And no choice, either.

00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:17.708
Come on, man, she is the miss universe
Of lying skanks, okay?

00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:20.387
She told you that she could
Save me, huh? Lie!

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:21.918
She seems know everything about Lilith

00:05:21.918 --> 00:05:24.214
But forgot to mention --
oh,Right -- Lilith owns my soul!

00:05:24.214 --> 00:05:26.319
Okay, fine, she's a liar.
She's still got that knife.

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.753
- Dean?
- For all we know,she works for Lilith.

00:05:27.753 --> 00:05:28.806
Give me another option Dean.

00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:30.146
- Tell me what else
- Sam is right.

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:31.773
No! Damn it!

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.896
Just no.

00:05:39.235 --> 00:05:42.105
We are not gonna make the same
Mistakes all over again.

00:05:45.073 --> 00:05:48.420
You guys want to save me,
Find something else.

00:05:57.989 --> 00:05:59.903
Where you going, Bobby?

00:05:59.903 --> 00:06:02.006
I guess to...

00:06:02.772 --> 00:06:05.643
Find something else

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:25.735
Ad constringendum,

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:32.145
Ad ligandum eos pariter Et solvendum.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:46.018
Et ad congregantum eos coram me.

00:07:04.702 --> 00:07:07.571
You know, Phones work, too.

00:07:07.668 --> 00:07:09.295
Hey, Sam.

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:10.155
How's tricks?

00:07:10.155 --> 00:07:11.398
How do you get around so fast?

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:14.269
I got the super bowl jetpack.

00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:15.990
So...

00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:18.669
You called?

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:20.296
Did you know?

00:07:20.296 --> 00:07:22.019
I'm gonna need a tiny bit more.

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:25.463
About Dean's deal --
That Lilith holds the contract.

00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:27.664
Yes. I did.

00:07:29.386 --> 00:07:32.256
And, what, you didn't think that was important?

00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:33.404
- You weren't ready.
- For what?

00:07:33.404 --> 00:07:36.180
If i told you,you two yahoos

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.188
Would have just charged
After her half-cocked,

00:07:38.188 --> 00:07:39.624
And Lilith would have peeled the meat

00:07:39.624 --> 00:07:42.015
From your pretty, pretty faces.

00:07:42.015 --> 00:07:44.789
Well, we're ready now.

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:47.373
I want your knife.

00:07:48.425 --> 00:07:51.295
You're right about one thing.

00:07:51.393 --> 00:07:53.689
You are ready.

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:56.080
And now's the time, too

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.993
Lilith's guard's down.

00:07:57.993 --> 00:08:00.098
Is that so?

00:08:00.098 --> 00:08:02.968
She's on shore leave,
A little r&r.

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:04.022
What the hell does that ?

00:08:04.022 --> 00:08:06.891
Trust me. You don't wanna know.

00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:09.187
You didn't lose
Those hex bags i gave you?

00:08:09.187 --> 00:08:12.058
- We got 'em.
-Good. Then she won't sense you're coming.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.597
So, you'll give us the knife?

00:08:15.597 --> 00:08:17.320
No.

00:08:17.608 --> 00:08:18.564
But you just said --

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:21.434
You want to charge in
With one little pigsticker?

00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:23.252
It's a waste of a true-blue window,

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:25.549
Like hitting hitler
With that exploding briefcase -- forget it.

00:08:25.549 --> 00:08:27.462
Ok, then how?

00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:31.001
I know you wanna save your brother, Sam.

00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:32.342
No, you don't.

00:08:32.342 --> 00:08:33.490
You told Dean you couldn't.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.117
You have been lying to me all along!

00:08:35.117 --> 00:08:37.030
So, just give me your damn knife!

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.273
You're not the one that i've been lying to.

00:08:38.273 --> 00:08:41.144
- Oh, so you can save him?
- No.

00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:43.823
But you can.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:44.883
What?

00:08:44.883 --> 00:08:48.711
Sam, you've got some god-given talent.

00:08:49.094 --> 00:08:52.538
Well, not god given,
But you get the gist.

00:08:52.538 --> 00:08:54.643
All that psychic crap?

00:08:54.643 --> 00:08:57.035
That's gone ever since
Yellow eyes died.

00:08:57.035 --> 00:08:58.565
Not gone.

00:08:58.565 --> 00:09:00.385
Dormant.

00:09:00.385 --> 00:09:02.583
And not just visions,either.

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:05.455
Why do you think Lilith is so scared of you?

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.890
Right, she's scared of me.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.664
If you wanted, you could wipe her off the map
Without moving a muscle.

00:09:09.664 --> 00:09:11.290
- I don't believe you.
- It's the truth.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.586
And you decided to tell me this just now?

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.883
Um...demon.

00:09:15.883 --> 00:09:18.754
"manipulative" is kind of
In the job description.

00:09:19.328 --> 00:09:21.624
The fact is, is that you never
Would have considered it,

00:09:21.624 --> 00:09:24.494
- Not until you were --
- Desperate enough?

00:09:26.694 --> 00:09:29.566
You don't like being different.

00:09:29.661 --> 00:09:31.957
You hate the way Dean
Looks at you sometimes,

00:09:31.957 --> 00:09:34.827
Like you're some sort of sideshow freak.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.889
But suck it up because we got
A lot of ground to cover,

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:39.037
And we got to do it fast.

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:41.429
But we can do it.

00:09:42.578 --> 00:09:44.586
Look,call me a bitch and hate me if you want.

00:09:44.586 --> 00:09:47.457
But i have never lied to you, Sam.

00:09:47.648 --> 00:09:49.371
Not ever.

00:09:49.371 --> 00:09:51.092
And i'telling you --

00:09:51.092 --> 00:09:54.249
You can save your brother.

00:09:54.345 --> 00:09:56.260
And i can show you how.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.895
So, that's you, huh?

00:09:57.895 --> 00:10:00.191
Our slutty little yoda.

00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:02.008
Dean.

00:10:03.348 --> 00:10:04.496
Charming as ever.

00:10:04.496 --> 00:10:06.697
Oh, i knew you'd show up...

00:10:06.697 --> 00:10:09.566
'Cause i knew Sam wouldn't listen!

00:10:09.566 --> 00:10:11.480
But you're not gonna
Teach him anything.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.490
You understand me?
Over my dead body.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.786
Oh. Well, you're right about that.

00:10:15.786 --> 00:10:17.986
What you are gonna do
Is give me that knife.

00:10:17.986 --> 00:10:20.857
Then you can go crawl back
Into whatever slop you came from

00:10:21.047 --> 00:10:23.153
And never bother me
Or my brother again.Are we clear?

00:10:23.153 --> 00:10:24.971
Your brother is carrying
A bomb inside of him,

00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:26.789
And we'd be stupid not to use it.

00:10:26.789 --> 00:10:27.555
Dean, look,Just hold on --

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:29.946
Sam, don't. Come on, man.
What are you, blind?

00:10:29.946 --> 00:10:31.190
Can't you see That this is a trick?

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.721
- That's not true.
- She wants you to givin

00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:35.017
To this whole demonic,
Psychic whatever, okay?

00:10:35.017 --> 00:10:37.792
Hell, she probably Wants you to
become her little "antichrist superstar."

00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:39.706
I want Lilith dead.

00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:41.619
- That's all.
- Why?

00:10:41.619 --> 00:10:42.767
I've told you why.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.871
Oh, right, yeah.Because you were human once,

00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:47.455
And you liked kittens
And long walks on the beach.

00:10:47.455 --> 00:10:50.133
You know, i am so sick
Of proving myself to you.

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:52.048
You want to save yourself,
This is how,

00:10:52.048 --> 00:10:54.631
You dumb, spineless dick!

00:11:03.337 --> 00:11:04.773
Whoa! Ruby, hey!

00:11:24.204 --> 00:11:27.074
What the hell are you grinning at?

00:11:27.648 --> 00:11:30.231
Missing something?

00:11:30.709 --> 00:11:33.579
I'll kill you,You son of a bitch.

00:11:43.722 --> 00:11:45.731
Like i said...

00:11:45.731 --> 00:11:48.410
I knew you'd come.

00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:50.324
Wait!

00:11:50.324 --> 00:11:52.047
You're just gonna leave me here?

00:11:52.047 --> 00:11:54.246
Let's go, Sam.

00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:57.404
Oh, so, you're just too stupid
To live, is that it?

00:11:57.404 --> 00:12:00.178
Then fine.You deserve hell.

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:01.709
I wish i could be there, Dean.

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:05.154
I wish i could smell the flesh
Sizzle off your bones!

00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:07.641
I wish i could be there
To hear you scream!

00:12:07.641 --> 00:12:09.458
And i wish you'd
Shut your piehole,

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:11.851
But we don't always get what we want.

00:12:32.115 --> 00:12:33.742
What, you gonna let Ruby
Rot down there?

00:12:33.742 --> 00:12:35.656
That's the idea.

00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:39.483
Dean, what if, uh...

00:12:39.866 --> 00:12:41.875
what if Ruby is right?

00:12:42.067 --> 00:12:43.884
What if i can take Lilith

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.668
Quit looking at me like that.

00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:50.964
What, are you goe Her the "carrie" stare,
And Lilith goes poof?

00:12:50.964 --> 00:12:52.017
I don't know what Ruby meant.

00:12:52.878 --> 00:12:54.601
you know, maybe we should just go and ask her

00:12:54.601 --> 00:12:56.227
Sam, you wanted the knife.
I got you the knife.

00:12:56.227 --> 00:12:57.662
Dean, just listen to me for a second.

00:12:57.662 --> 00:12:59.958
Last time, Lilith snapped her fingers

00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.116
And put 30 demons on our ass,
and all we got's one little knife?

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.934
I mean, like you said, we go in
Smart or we don't go in at all.

00:13:04.934 --> 00:13:05.794
Well, this ain't smart.

00:13:05.794 --> 00:13:07.803
We got one shot at this, Dean --
Just one.

00:13:08.186 --> 00:13:09.621
So, if there's A surefire way,

00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:11.630
They maybe we should Just talk about it.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.979
Sam, we are not gonna make
The same mistake all over again.

00:13:14.979 --> 00:13:16.606
You said that,
But what does that even mean?

00:13:16.606 --> 00:13:17.851
Don't you see a pattern here?

00:13:18.137 --> 00:13:21.295
Dad's deal,My deal, now this?

00:13:21.295 --> 00:13:24.643
Every time one of us is up to the crick
The other is begging to sell their soul

00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:26.556
That's all this is, man.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.852
Ruby's jrut jerking your chain down the road.

00:13:29.331 --> 00:13:32.488
You know what's it's paved with,
And you know where it's going.

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:35.358
Dean.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.960
What are you afraid's gonna happen?

00:13:42.056 --> 00:13:44.065
This is me.I can handle it.

00:13:44.353 --> 00:13:45.405
And if it'll save you --

00:13:45.405 --> 00:13:46.744
Why even risk it?

00:13:48.466 --> 00:13:50.093
Because you're my brother.

00:13:51.815 --> 00:13:53.537
Because you did the same thing for me.

00:13:54.781 --> 00:13:56.886
i know.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.183
And look how that turned out.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.775
All i'm saying...

00:14:06.071 --> 00:14:09.515
Sammy, all i'm saying is
That you're my weak pot

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.141
You are.

00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:13.726
And i'm yours.

00:14:15.352 --> 00:14:17.840
You don't mean that.
We're -- we're family.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.796
I know.

00:14:19.371 --> 00:14:21.571
And those evil son
Of bitches know it, too.

00:14:23.198 --> 00:14:25.780
I mean, what we'll do For each other,
you know, How far we will go --

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.408
They're using that against us.

00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:29.321
So, what, we just stop
Looking out for each other?

00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:31.138
no. we stop Being martyrs, man.

00:14:31.617 --> 00:14:35.635
We stop spreading it for these demons.

00:14:35.635 --> 00:14:37.549
Take this knife.

00:14:37.549 --> 00:14:40.802
And we go after Lilith our way,
The way dad taught us to.

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:45.969
Ane go down,Then, uh...

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.265
Then we go down swinging.

00:14:51.135 --> 00:14:52.762
What do you think?

00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:00.128
I think you totally should have
been jam"eye of the tiger"there.

00:15:00.128 --> 00:15:02.329
Oh, bite me.

00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:06.634
I totally rehearsed That s bitch too.

00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:08.165
So, Indiana, huh?

00:15:08.165 --> 00:15:10.366
Yeah, where Lilith iIs on shore leave.

00:15:10.462 --> 00:15:12.375

Tell me something --

00:15:15.534 --> 00:15:17.064

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:35.275
What the hell happened?

00:21:35.275 --> 00:21:37.189

00:21:37.189 --> 00:21:39.676
How'd you know?

00:21:39.676 --> 00:21:41.590
I just knew.

00:21:41.782 --> 00:21:46.087
I could see its face,
Its real face under that one.

00:21:59.325 --> 00:22:00.951
so what? now you are seeing demons?

00:22:00.951 --> 00:22:03.822
I am seeing all kinds of things lately,
but nothing like this.

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:05.639
Actually, it's not all that crazy.

00:22:06.405 --> 00:22:07.553
how is It not that crazy?

00:22:07.553 --> 00:22:09.466

It'll actually come in pretty handy.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.019

00:22:26.019 --> 00:22:27.262

We can't let 'em sound the alarm.

00:22:31.472 --> 00:22:33.481
If she knows we're here,
We're dead before we started.

00:22:33.481 --> 00:22:35.012
Wow, this is a terrif plan.

00:22:35.012 --> 00:22:36.256
I'm excited to be a part of it.

00:22:36.256 --> 00:22:37.882
Can we go, please?

00:22:46.589 --> 00:22:48.120
