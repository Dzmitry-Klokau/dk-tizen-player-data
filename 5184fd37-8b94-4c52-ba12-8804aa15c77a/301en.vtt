00:09.060 --> 00:10.460
dean:
look,dad's gone now.


00:10.500 --> 00:11.960
we have to carry out his legacy,


00:12.000 --> 00:14.360
and that means hunting down
as many evil sons of bitches


00:14.400 --> 00:16.030
as we possibly can.


00:19.900 --> 00:21.330
whoops.


01:14.500 --> 01:16.730
let me guess -- you're
offering up your own soul?


01:16.760 --> 01:18.130
all you got to do
is bring sam back.


01:18.160 --> 01:20.400
i'll give you one year
and one year only.


01:20.430 --> 01:23.360
if you try and weasel your way
out,then the deal is off.


01:25.760 --> 01:27.700
yellow-eyed demon:
how certain are you


01:27.730 --> 01:31.760
that what you brought back
is 100% pure sam?


01:38.500 --> 01:40.260
what the hell
just happened?


01:40.300 --> 01:43.260
that's a devil's gate,
a damn door to hell!


01:45.000 --> 01:47.100
hope to hell
you boys are ready


01:47.130 --> 01:48.800
'cause the war
has just begun.


04:52.060 --> 04:54.160
sam: hello.


04:54.200 --> 04:55.160
hey,sam.


04:55.200 --> 04:57.000
hey,bobby.
what you doing?


04:57.030 --> 04:58.430
oh,same old,same old.


04:58.460 --> 05:00.530
you buried
in that book again?


05:00.560 --> 05:04.360
sam,you want to break dean free
of that demon deal,


05:04.400 --> 05:06.660
you ain't gonna find the answer
in no book.


05:06.700 --> 05:07.960
then where,bobby?


05:08.000 --> 05:10.330
kid,i wish i knew.


05:10.360 --> 05:13.360
so,where's your brother?


05:13.400 --> 05:15.530
polling the electorate.
what?


05:15.560 --> 05:17.800
never mind.
well,you boys better
pack it up.


05:17.830 --> 05:20.030
i think i finally
found something.


05:20.060 --> 05:22.660
* she looked at me
with big brown eyes *
[ knock on door ]


05:22.700 --> 05:25.700
dean?
* and said,
"you ain't seen nothing yet" *


05:25.730 --> 05:27.630
dean,you -- you conscious?


05:27.660 --> 05:30.660
bobby called,
and he thinks that maybe we --


05:30.700 --> 05:32.430
oh,god.


05:37.730 --> 05:39.460
let me see your knife.


05:39.500 --> 05:40.760
what for?


05:40.800 --> 05:42.500
so i can gouge my eyes out.


05:43.860 --> 05:45.900
it was a beautiful,
natural act,sam.


05:45.930 --> 05:48.760
it's a part of you i never
wanted to see,dean.


05:50.160 --> 05:52.330
hey,i appreciate you giving me
a little quality time


05:52.360 --> 05:53.660
with the doublemint twins.


05:53.700 --> 05:55.960
no problem.


05:56.000 --> 05:57.360
really?


05:57.400 --> 05:58.860
well,i got to say,


05:58.900 --> 06:02.330
i was expecting a weary sigh
or an eye roll,something.


06:02.360 --> 06:04.360
not at all. you deserve
to have a little fun.


06:04.400 --> 06:07.230
well,i'm in violent agreement
with you there.


06:07.260 --> 06:09.960
[ chuckles ]
what's bobby got?
not much.


06:10.000 --> 06:12.330
crop failure and a cicada swarm
outside of lincoln,nebraska.


06:12.360 --> 06:14.030
could be demonic omens.


06:14.060 --> 06:16.830
or could just be a bad crop
and a bug problem.
but it's our only lead.


06:16.860 --> 06:19.760
any freaky deaths?
nothing bobby could find --
not yet,anyway.


06:19.800 --> 06:21.960
it's weird,man. the night
the devil's gate opened,


06:22.000 --> 06:23.460
all these weirdo
storm clouds


06:23.500 --> 06:24.760
were sighted
over how many cities?


06:24.800 --> 06:25.900
17.
17.


06:25.930 --> 06:27.560
you think it would be
"apocalypse now,"


06:27.600 --> 06:30.360
but it's been five days
and bubkes.


06:32.200 --> 06:33.500
what are the demons
waiting for?


06:33.530 --> 06:35.130
beats me.


06:35.160 --> 06:36.260
driving me crazy.


06:36.300 --> 06:37.730
i tell you,
if it's gonna be war,


06:37.760 --> 06:39.260
i wish it would just
start already.


06:39.300 --> 06:40.730
be careful
what you wish for.


06:56.300 --> 06:57.660
hear those cicadas?


06:57.700 --> 07:00.100
that can't be
a good sign.


07:00.130 --> 07:01.730
no. no,it can't.


07:05.760 --> 07:07.830
so,we're eating
bacon cheeseburgers


07:07.860 --> 07:09.630
for breakfast,are we?


07:09.660 --> 07:12.930
well,sold my soul.
got a year to live.


07:12.960 --> 07:15.530
i ain't sweating
the cholesterol.


07:15.560 --> 07:16.860
so,bobby,
what do you think?


07:16.900 --> 07:18.360
we got a biblical plague here
or what?


07:18.400 --> 07:19.830
well,let's find out.


07:19.860 --> 07:22.030
looks like the swarm's
ground zero.


07:23.960 --> 07:26.260
candygram!


07:42.060 --> 07:43.830
that's awful.


07:43.860 --> 07:46.130
that so can't be
a good sign.


08:19.060 --> 08:20.860
you hear that?


08:34.730 --> 08:36.830
this is supposed to be
my birthday party.


08:36.860 --> 08:37.930
oh,my god.


08:48.230 --> 08:52.360
grandma is making out
the invitation list.


08:52.400 --> 08:54.400
sue ellen is gonna hire...


08:54.430 --> 08:56.800
bobby,what the hell
happened here?
i don't know.


08:56.830 --> 08:58.160
and j.r.'s gonna use it...


08:58.200 --> 08:59.760
check for sulfur.


08:59.800 --> 09:01.500
...for one of his big deals!


09:01.530 --> 09:04.800
and now you're gonna buy
my clothes!


09:04.830 --> 09:07.700
i hate this family!


09:59.800 --> 10:02.600
bobby: isaac? tamara?


10:04.200 --> 10:05.260
[ british accent ]
bobby.


10:05.300 --> 10:06.600
what the hell are you
doing here?


10:06.630 --> 10:07.700
i could ask the same.


10:07.730 --> 10:09.430
heya,bobby.


10:09.460 --> 10:12.560
hello. bleeding here.


10:16.030 --> 10:18.360
bobby: isaac,you sure got
some nice digs here.


10:18.400 --> 10:20.000
yeah.
if i can find anything.


10:20.030 --> 10:23.860
honey...
where's the palo santo?


10:23.900 --> 10:25.400
well,where'd you leave it?


10:25.430 --> 10:28.400
i don't know,dear.
that's why i'm asking.


10:28.430 --> 10:29.860
palo santo?


10:29.900 --> 10:32.360
it's holy wood from peru.


10:32.400 --> 10:36.060
it's toxic to demons
like holy water.


10:36.100 --> 10:39.730
keeps the bastards nailed down
while you're exorcising them.


10:39.760 --> 10:41.330
thank you,dear.


10:41.360 --> 10:44.930
you'd lose your head
if it wasn't for me.


10:44.960 --> 10:47.200
so,how long you two
been married?


10:47.230 --> 10:49.230
eight years
this past june.


10:50.630 --> 10:52.230
the family
that slays together...


10:52.260 --> 10:53.700
right.
i'm with you there.


10:53.730 --> 10:55.030
so,how'd you get started?


11:01.330 --> 11:03.630
oh,you know...
i'm sorry.


11:03.660 --> 11:06.060
it's not --
that's none of my business.


11:06.100 --> 11:07.930
it's -- it's all right.


11:07.960 --> 11:11.700
well,jenny,if you look
as pretty as you sound,


11:11.730 --> 11:15.400
then i'd love to have
an appletini.


11:15.430 --> 11:17.060
yeah. call you.


11:17.100 --> 11:19.960
that was
the coroner's tech.
and?


11:20.000 --> 11:22.800
get this -- that whole family,
'cause of death --


11:22.830 --> 11:24.730
dehydration and starvation.


11:24.760 --> 11:27.060
there's no signs of restraint,
no violence,no struggle.


11:27.100 --> 11:28.700
they just sat down
and never got up.


11:28.730 --> 11:30.960
but there was a fully stocked
kitchen just yards away.


11:31.000 --> 11:32.360
what is this,
a demon attack?


11:32.400 --> 11:34.630
if it is,it's not like
anything i ever saw,


11:34.660 --> 11:35.730
and i've seen plenty.


11:35.760 --> 11:37.530
what now?
what should we do?


11:37.560 --> 11:39.400
uh,we're not gonna
do anything.


11:39.430 --> 11:40.600
what do you mean?


11:40.630 --> 11:41.830
you guys seem nice enough,


11:41.860 --> 11:43.300
but this ain't
"scooby-doo,"


11:43.330 --> 11:45.030
and we don't play well
with others.


11:45.060 --> 11:47.530
we'd cover a lot more ground
if we all worked together.


11:47.560 --> 11:49.800
no offense,but we're not
teaming with the damn fools


11:49.830 --> 11:52.130
who let the devil's gate
get open in the first place.


11:52.160 --> 11:53.930
no offense?


11:53.960 --> 11:56.160
isaac,like you've never made
a mistake.


11:56.200 --> 11:59.130
yeah,locked my keys in the car,
turned my laundry pink.


11:59.160 --> 12:01.630
never brought on the end
of the world,though.


12:01.660 --> 12:03.230
[ chuckles ]
all right. that's enough.


12:03.260 --> 12:04.830
guys,this isn't helping.
dean --


12:04.860 --> 12:07.830
look,there are couple hundred
more demons out there now.


12:07.860 --> 12:10.060
we don't know where they are,
when they'll strike.


12:10.100 --> 12:12.100
there ain't enough hunters
in the world


12:12.130 --> 12:13.760
to handle something
like this.


12:13.800 --> 12:16.730
you brought war down on us --
on all of us.


12:16.760 --> 12:19.930
okay. that's quite enough
testosterone for now.


13:15.430 --> 13:17.030
excuse me.


13:17.060 --> 13:18.030
yes?


13:19.900 --> 13:21.960
those are...nice shoes.


13:23.560 --> 13:26.800
oh,yeah.
they are nice.


13:33.460 --> 13:34.960
those are nice shoes.


13:35.000 --> 13:36.630
aren't they?


13:37.960 --> 13:39.260
i want them.


13:39.300 --> 13:40.800
sorry. last pair.


13:50.430 --> 13:52.700
excuse me.


13:52.730 --> 13:53.860
i want those shoes.


13:53.900 --> 13:57.430
what,are you crazy?
no. what?


14:27.160 --> 14:29.300
dean: what happened outside
makes you realize


14:29.330 --> 14:30.600
how fragile life really is.


14:30.630 --> 14:33.700
you got to make
every second count.


14:35.400 --> 14:37.130
excuse me a minute,
would you?


14:37.160 --> 14:38.130
sure.


14:39.460 --> 14:40.830
dean,what are you doing?


14:40.860 --> 14:42.700
i'm comforting
the bereaved.


14:42.730 --> 14:43.800
what are you doing?


14:43.830 --> 14:44.830
working.


14:44.860 --> 14:46.860
dead body,
possible demon attack --


14:46.900 --> 14:48.030
that kind of stuff.


14:48.060 --> 14:49.460
sam,i'm sorry.


14:49.500 --> 14:51.830
it's just i don't have
much time left,and...


14:53.030 --> 14:55.400
...got to make
every second count.


14:55.430 --> 14:57.630
yeah,right. sorry.


14:57.660 --> 14:59.060
apology accepted.


14:59.100 --> 15:01.630
whoa. [ whistles ]
looking spiffy,bobby.


15:01.660 --> 15:03.060
what were you,a g-man?


15:03.100 --> 15:05.060
attorney
for the d.a.'s office.


15:05.100 --> 15:06.800
i just spoke
to the suspect.


15:06.830 --> 15:09.530
yeah? so,what do you think?
is she possessed or what?


15:09.560 --> 15:10.760
don't think so.


15:10.800 --> 15:12.560
there's none
of the usual signs --


15:12.600 --> 15:15.230
no blackouts,
no loss of control.


15:15.260 --> 15:16.730
totally lucid.


15:16.760 --> 15:19.460
just,she really wanted
those shoes.


15:19.500 --> 15:22.600
spilled a glass of holy water
on her just to be sure.


15:22.630 --> 15:24.230
nothing.


15:24.260 --> 15:26.230
maybe she's just some
random wack job.


15:26.260 --> 15:28.460
if it had been an isolated
incident,maybe,


15:28.500 --> 15:30.160
but first the family,
now this?


15:30.200 --> 15:31.830
i believe
in a lot of things.


15:31.860 --> 15:33.330
coincidence
ain't one of them.


15:33.360 --> 15:35.700
did you boys find anything
around here?


15:35.730 --> 15:37.030
no sulfur,nothing.


15:37.060 --> 15:39.260
well,maybe something.


15:42.660 --> 15:45.260
see? i'm working.


15:46.600 --> 15:48.330
anything interesting?


15:48.360 --> 15:49.660
i don't know yet.


15:49.700 --> 15:51.400
might just be a guy...


15:51.430 --> 15:53.500
or it might be our guy.


16:31.560 --> 16:33.900
what time is it?


16:33.930 --> 16:35.860
seven past midnight.


16:37.160 --> 16:39.500
you sure this is
the right place?
no.


16:39.530 --> 16:42.000
but i spent all day canvassing
this stupid town


16:42.030 --> 16:44.260
with this guy's stupid mug,


16:44.300 --> 16:47.730
and,supposedly,
he drinks at this stupid bar.


16:50.730 --> 16:51.930
that's not funny!


16:51.960 --> 16:55.100
yeah.
uh,all right,so --


16:55.130 --> 16:58.030
so,john doe's name
is walter rosen.


16:58.060 --> 16:59.960
he's from oak park,
just west of chicago.


17:00.000 --> 17:01.500
went missing
about a week ago.


17:01.530 --> 17:03.730
the night
the devil's gate opened?
yeah.


17:03.760 --> 17:05.760
so you think
he's possessed?
it's a good bet.


17:05.800 --> 17:08.300
so,what,he just walks up
to someone,touches them,


17:08.330 --> 17:10.000
and they go
stark raving psycho?


17:10.030 --> 17:11.660
those demons that got out
at the gate --


17:11.700 --> 17:13.960
they're gonna do all kinds
of things we haven't seen.


17:14.000 --> 17:15.560
you mean the demons
we let out?


17:15.600 --> 17:17.600
guys.


17:21.630 --> 17:23.660
all right. showtime.


17:23.700 --> 17:25.060
wait a minute.
what?


17:25.100 --> 17:26.200
what did i just say?


17:26.230 --> 17:28.560
we don't know what to expect
out of this guy.


17:28.600 --> 17:30.830
we should tail him
till we know for sure.


17:30.860 --> 17:33.000
oh,so he kills someone
and we just sit here?


17:33.030 --> 17:34.700
we're no good dead!


17:34.730 --> 17:36.700
and we're not gonna make
a move


17:36.730 --> 17:38.300
until we know
what the score is.


17:38.330 --> 17:40.630
hey,bobby,i don't think
that's an option.


17:40.660 --> 17:41.760
why not?


17:48.700 --> 17:49.760
damn it!


17:58.430 --> 17:59.460
thanks.


17:59.500 --> 18:00.630
you're welcome.


18:23.900 --> 18:26.500
pull the car in back.


18:26.530 --> 18:29.200
we'll be right out.


18:29.230 --> 18:31.430

18:43.730 --> 18:44.960
no.


18:45.000 --> 18:49.330
i mean,what do you think
you're doing here?


18:51.860 --> 18:55.000
i don't like hunters
in my bar.

like that.


19:26.910 --> 19:30.210
i can think of about a thousand
things i'd like to do to her.


19:30.250 --> 19:32.850
you're not gonna lay
one filthy finger on her!


19:32.880 --> 19:34.380

to that bar.

i'm dead already!


21:31.110 --> 21:33.980
how you gonna kill 'em?
can't shoot 'em.


21:34.010 --> 21:35.280
you can't stab 'em.


21:35.310 --> 21:37.510
they're not just gonna wait
in line to get exorcised!


21:37.550 --> 21:38.750
i don't care!


21:38.780 --> 21:41.110
we don't even know how many
of them there are!


21:41.150 --> 21:43.210
yeah,we do.
there's seven.


21:43.250 --> 21:46.750

who we're up against?


21:46.780 --> 21:48.180
no. who?

the seven deadly sins,

"binsfeld's classification
of demons."

22:13.050 --> 22:16.550
not just as human vices
but as actual devils.


22:16.580 --> 22:19.680
the family --
they were touched by sloth.


22:19.710 --> 22:20.980
and the shopper...

that's envy's doing --

i couldn't suss it out at first
until isaac.

with an awful gluttony.

i don't give a rat's ass

or the four tops!


22:33.210 --> 22:36.210
i'm gonna slaughter
every last one of them!


22:36.250 --> 22:38.180

22:47.450 --> 22:50.110
we've never faced anything
close to this!


22:50.150 --> 22:52.350
so we are gonna
take a breath...


22:52.380 --> 22:55.180
and figure out
what our next move is!


23:01.080 --> 23:04.210
i am sorry for your loss.

on their outside.

i'm gonna put you down
like a dog.

you're better than me.

the first stone,huh?


24:50.480 --> 24:52.480
what about you,dean?


24:52.510 --> 24:55.410
you're practically
a walking billboard


24:55.450 --> 24:57.650
of gluttony and lust.


24:57.680 --> 25:01.080
and,tamara,
all that wrath.


25:01.110 --> 25:03.650
ooh. tsk,tsk,tsk,
tsk,tsk,tsk,tsk.


25:03.680 --> 25:05.810
it's the reason you and isaac
became hunters


25:05.850 --> 25:07.380
in the first place,
isn't it?


25:07.410 --> 25:11.380
it's so much easier
to drink in the rage


25:11.410 --> 25:15.350
than to face what really
happened all those years ago.


25:15.380 --> 25:16.710
aah!


25:17.780 --> 25:18.750
whew!


25:18.780 --> 25:21.080
[ laughs ]


25:24.350 --> 25:26.250
my point exactly.


25:26.280 --> 25:28.950
and you call us sins.


25:28.980 --> 25:30.780
we're not sins,man.


25:30.810 --> 25:33.980
we are natural
human instinct.


25:33.980 --> 25:37.080
and you can repress and deny us
all you want,


25:37.110 --> 25:41.380
but the truth is,
you are just animals.


25:42.680 --> 25:44.180
horny...


25:44.210 --> 25:46.080
greedy...


25:46.110 --> 25:47.910
hungry...


25:49.410 --> 25:50.950
...violent animals.


25:50.980 --> 25:52.750
and you know what?


25:52.780 --> 25:55.410
you'll be slaughtered
like animals,too.


26:00.810 --> 26:03.580
the others --


26:03.610 --> 26:06.250
they're coming for me.


26:06.280 --> 26:08.110
maybe.


26:10.280 --> 26:12.610
but they're not
gonna find you...

'cause you'll be in hell.

this clown packing.

i don't think we're gonna have
to worry about hunting them.


26:39.510 --> 26:40.780
what does that mean?


26:40.810 --> 26:42.880
i think maybe
this joker's right.


26:42.910 --> 26:44.410
they're gonna be
hunting us.

and they're not gonna
quit easy.

why don't you take tamara

you're insane,dean.

26:54.550 --> 26:56.150

there's six of them,guys.

we're outgunned.


27:01.780 --> 27:03.080
we'll be dead by dawn.

to run that they won't find us.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.480

you left me behind
back there.


29:19.010 --> 29:20.580
how could you do that?


29:20.610 --> 29:23.580
we swore...

at that lake in michigan.


29:25.780 --> 29:27.150

29:27.180 --> 29:30.510
we swore we would never
leave each other!

out here?

let me die?!

you do,dear!

like that

looking at you now,
i got to tell you,


32:00.650 --> 32:03.810
don't believe the hype.

your ass.

all right?

warmed over.

and see how you feel.

well,the pretty girl
and the heavy guy,

ahead,but,still...

that's more than you can say
for these poor bastards.

bobby,that knife --


34:38.300 --> 34:40.060
what kind of blade
can kill a demon?


34:40.100 --> 34:42.700
yesterday,i would have said
there was no such thing.


34:42.730 --> 34:45.730
i'm just gonna ask it again --
who was that masked chick?


34:45.760 --> 34:47.560
actually,the more troubling
question would be,


34:47.600 --> 34:49.660
"how come a girl can fight
better than you?"


34:49.700 --> 34:52.100
three demons,dean...
at once.

hey,whatever it takes to get
you through the night,pal.


34:55.730 --> 34:57.560
yeah,well,if you want
a troubling question,


34:57.600 --> 34:58.730
i got one for you --


34:58.760 --> 35:00.400
if we let out
the seven deadly sins,


35:00.430 --> 35:02.730
what else did we let out?


35:04.860 --> 35:06.800
you're right.
that is troubling.


35:17.960 --> 35:20.330
see you gents around.


35:20.360 --> 35:21.930
tamara?


35:24.030 --> 35:26.160

a lot scarier.


35:26.200 --> 35:29.030
be careful.


35:29.060 --> 35:31.060
you too.


35:37.360 --> 35:40.060
keep your eyes peeled
for omens.


35:40.100 --> 35:41.360
i'll do the same.


35:41.400 --> 35:42.760
you got it.


35:42.800 --> 35:44.600
wait,bobby.


35:46.530 --> 35:49.230
we can win this war,
right?


35:57.760 --> 35:59.800

on the next one.


36:14.700 --> 36:16.300
so,where to?


36:18.100 --> 36:21.930
uh,i don't know.
i was thinking louisiana maybe.


36:21.960 --> 36:24.630
little early for mardi gras,
isn't it?
yeah.


36:24.660 --> 36:25.930
listen,
i was talking to tamara,


36:25.960 --> 36:27.460
and she mentioned
this hoodoo priestess


36:27.500 --> 36:29.530
outside of shreveport that might
be able to help us out,


36:29.560 --> 36:32.360
you know,with your --
with your demon deal.


36:32.400 --> 36:34.500
nah.


36:34.530 --> 36:37.430
"nah"?
what does that mean,"nah"?


36:37.460 --> 36:39.560
sam,no hoodoo spell's
gonna break this deal.


36:39.600 --> 36:40.560
it's a goose chase.


36:40.600 --> 36:41.700
we don't know that.
yes,we do.


36:41.730 --> 36:43.130
forget it.
she can't help.


36:43.160 --> 36:45.700
we're not going,
and that's that.


36:45.730 --> 36:47.530
what about reno,huh?


36:47.560 --> 36:49.930
you know what?


36:49.960 --> 36:51.360
i've had it.


36:51.400 --> 36:54.130
i've been bending over backwards
trying to be nice to you,


36:54.160 --> 36:56.300
and...i don't care anymore.


36:56.330 --> 36:57.400
that didn't last long.


36:57.430 --> 36:58.800
yeah,well,you know what?


36:58.830 --> 37:01.360
i've been busting my ass
trying to keep you alive,dean,


37:01.400 --> 37:03.100
and you act like
you couldn't care less.


37:03.130 --> 37:05.100
what,you got some kind of
death wish or something?


37:05.130 --> 37:06.260
it's not like that.


37:06.300 --> 37:07.360
then what's it like,dean?


37:07.400 --> 37:08.500
sam --
please,tell me.


37:11.260 --> 37:14.200
we trap the crossroads demon,
trick it,


37:14.230 --> 37:16.430
try to welsh our way
out of the deal in any way,


37:16.460 --> 37:19.460
you die,okay?


37:19.500 --> 37:20.700
you die.


37:20.730 --> 37:23.230
those are the terms.
there's no way out of it.


37:23.260 --> 37:24.600
if you try to find a way,


37:24.630 --> 37:26.560
so help me god,
i'm gonna stop you.


37:30.500 --> 37:31.800
[ sighs ]


37:31.830 --> 37:33.330
how could you make
that deal,dean?


37:34.700 --> 37:36.560
'cause i couldn't live
with you dead.


37:36.600 --> 37:37.760
couldn't do it.


37:37.800 --> 37:40.000
so,what,
now i live and you die?


37:40.030 --> 37:41.360
that's the general idea,
yeah.


37:41.400 --> 37:43.930
yeah,well,
you're a hypocrite,dean.


37:43.960 --> 37:46.000
how did you feel when dad
sold his soul for you?


37:46.030 --> 37:47.800
'cause i was there.
i remember.


37:47.830 --> 37:50.160
you were twisted and broken.


37:50.200 --> 37:54.900
and now you go and do
the same thing...to me.


37:54.930 --> 37:56.830
what you did was selfish.


37:56.860 --> 38:00.200
yeah,you're right.
it was selfish.


38:00.230 --> 38:01.530
but i'm okay with that.


38:01.560 --> 38:03.260
i'm not.
tough.


38:03.300 --> 38:05.030
after everything i've done
for this family,


38:05.060 --> 38:06.060
i think i'm entitled.


38:07.430 --> 38:10.230
truth is,i'm tired,sam.


38:10.260 --> 38:11.600
i don't know,


38:11.630 --> 38:13.800
it's like there's a light
at the end of the tunnel.


38:13.830 --> 38:14.800
it's hellfire,dean.


38:14.830 --> 38:16.400
whatever.


38:16.430 --> 38:18.060
you're alive,
i feel good...


38:18.100 --> 38:21.060
for the first time
in a long time.


38:21.100 --> 38:25.000
i got a year to live,sam.
i'd like to make the most of it.


38:25.030 --> 38:27.060
so what do you say we kill
some evil sons of bitches


38:27.100 --> 38:29.000
and we raise
a little hell,huh?


38:32.200 --> 38:34.530
you're unbelievable.


38:34.560 --> 38:37.260
very true.
