00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.860
dean:
look,dad's gone now.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.360
we have to carry out his legacy,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.760
and that means hunting down
as many evil sons of bitches

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.430
as we possibly can.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.730
whoops.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.130
let me guess -- you're
offering up your own soul?

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.530
all you got to do
is bring sam back.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.800
i'll give you one year
and one year only.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.760
if you try and weasel your way
out,then the deal is off.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.100
yellow-eyed demon:
how certain are you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.160
that what you brought back
is 100% pure sam?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.660
what the hell
just happened?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.660
that's a devil's gate,
a damn door to hell!

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.500
hope to hell
you boys are ready

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.200
'cause the war
has just begun.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.560
sam: hello.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.560
hey,sam.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.400
hey,bobby.
what you doing?

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.830
oh,same old,same old.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.930
you buried
in that book again?

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.760
sam,you want to break dean free
of that demon deal,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.060
you ain't gonna find the answer
in no book.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.360
then where,bobby?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.730
kid,i wish i knew.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.760
so,where's your brother?

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.930
polling the electorate.
what?

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.200
never mind.
well,you boys better
pack it up.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.430
i think i finally
found something.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.060
* she looked at me
with big brown eyes *
[ knock on door ]

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.100
dean?
* and said,
"you ain't seen nothing yet" *

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.030
dean,you -- you conscious?

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.060
bobby called,
and he thinks that maybe we --

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.830
oh,god.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.860
let me see your knife.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.160
what for?

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.900
so i can gouge my eyes out.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.300
it was a beautiful,
natural act,sam.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.160
it's a part of you i never
wanted to see,dean.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.730
hey,i appreciate you giving me
a little quality time

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.060
with the doublemint twins.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.360
no problem.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.760
really?

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.260
well,i got to say,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.730
i was expecting a weary sigh
or an eye roll,something.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.760
not at all. you deserve
to have a little fun.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.630
well,i'm in violent agreement
with you there.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.360
[ chuckles ]
what's bobby got?
not much.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.730
crop failure and a cicada swarm
outside of lincoln,nebraska.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.430
could be demonic omens.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.230
or could just be a bad crop
and a bug problem.
but it's our only lead.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.160
any freaky deaths?
nothing bobby could find --
not yet,anyway.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.360
it's weird,man. the night
the devil's gate opened,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.860
all these weirdo
storm clouds

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.160
were sighted
over how many cities?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.300
17.
17.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.960
you think it would be
"apocalypse now,"

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.760
but it's been five days
and bubkes.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.900
what are the demons
waiting for?

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.530
beats me.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.660
driving me crazy.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.130
i tell you,
if it's gonna be war,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.660
i wish it would just
start already.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.130
be careful
what you wish for.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.060
hear those cicadas?

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.500
that can't be
a good sign.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.130
no. no,it can't.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.230
so,we're eating
bacon cheeseburgers

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.030
for breakfast,are we?

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.330
well,sold my soul.
got a year to live.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.930
i ain't sweating
the cholesterol.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.260
so,bobby,
what do you think?

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.760
we got a biblical plague here
or what?

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.230
well,let's find out.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.430
looks like the swarm's
ground zero.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.660
candygram!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.230
that's awful.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.530
that so can't be
a good sign.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.260
you hear that?

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.230
this is supposed to be
my birthday party.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.330
oh,my god.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.760
grandma is making out
the invitation list.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.800
sue ellen is gonna hire...

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.200
bobby,what the hell
happened here?
i don't know.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.560
and j.r.'s gonna use it...

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.160
check for sulfur.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.900
...for one of his big deals!

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.200
and now you're gonna buy
my clothes!

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.100
i hate this family!

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.000
bobby: isaac? tamara?

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.660
[ british accent ]
bobby.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.000
what the hell are you
doing here?

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.100
i could ask the same.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.830
heya,bobby.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.960
hello. bleeding here.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.760
bobby: isaac,you sure got
some nice digs here.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.400
yeah.
if i can find anything.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.260
honey...
where's the palo santo?

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.800
well,where'd you leave it?

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.800
i don't know,dear.
that's why i'm asking.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.260
palo santo?

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.760
it's holy wood from peru.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.460
it's toxic to demons
like holy water.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.130
keeps the bastards nailed down
while you're exorcising them.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.730
thank you,dear.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.330
you'd lose your head
if it wasn't for me.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.600
so,how long you two
been married?

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.630
eight years
this past june.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.630
the family
that slays together...

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.100
right.
i'm with you there.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.430
so,how'd you get started?

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.030
oh,you know...
i'm sorry.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.460
it's not --
that's none of my business.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.330
it's -- it's all right.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.100
well,jenny,if you look
as pretty as you sound,

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.800
then i'd love to have
an appletini.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.460
yeah. call you.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.360
that was
the coroner's tech.
and?

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.200
get this -- that whole family,
'cause of death --

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.130
dehydration and starvation.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.460
there's no signs of restraint,
no violence,no struggle.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.100
they just sat down
and never got up.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.360
but there was a fully stocked
kitchen just yards away.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.760
what is this,
a demon attack?

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.030
if it is,it's not like
anything i ever saw,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.130
and i've seen plenty.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.930
what now?
what should we do?

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.800
uh,we're not gonna
do anything.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.000
what do you mean?

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.230
you guys seem nice enough,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.700
but this ain't
"scooby-doo,"

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.430
and we don't play well
with others.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.930
we'd cover a lot more ground
if we all worked together.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.200
no offense,but we're not
teaming with the damn fools

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.530
who let the devil's gate
get open in the first place.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.330
no offense?

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.560
isaac,like you've never made
a mistake.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.530
yeah,locked my keys in the car,
turned my laundry pink.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.030
never brought on the end
of the world,though.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.630
[ chuckles ]
all right. that's enough.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.230
guys,this isn't helping.
dean --

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.230
look,there are couple hundred
more demons out there now.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.460
we don't know where they are,
when they'll strike.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.500
there ain't enough hunters
in the world

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.160
to handle something
like this.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.130
you brought war down on us --
on all of us.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.330
okay. that's quite enough
testosterone for now.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.430
excuse me.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.430
yes?

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.360
those are...nice shoes.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.200
oh,yeah.
they are nice.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.360
those are nice shoes.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.030
aren't they?

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.660
i want them.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.200
sorry. last pair.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.100
excuse me.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.260
i want those shoes.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.830
what,are you crazy?
no. what?

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.700
dean: what happened outside
makes you realize

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.000
how fragile life really is.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.100
you got to make
every second count.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.530
excuse me a minute,
would you?

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.530
sure.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.230
dean,what are you doing?

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.100
i'm comforting
the bereaved.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.200
what are you doing?

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.230
working.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
dead body,
possible demon attack --

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.430
that kind of stuff.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.860
sam,i'm sorry.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.230
it's just i don't have
much time left,and...

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.800
...got to make
every second count.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.030
yeah,right. sorry.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.460
apology accepted.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.030
whoa. [ whistles ]
looking spiffy,bobby.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.460
what were you,a g-man?

attorney
for the d.a.'s office.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.200
i just spoke
to the suspect.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.930
yeah? so,what do you think?
is she possessed or what?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.160
don't think so.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.960
there's none
of the usual signs --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.630
no blackouts,
no loss of control.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.130
totally lucid.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.860
just,she really wanted
those shoes.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.000
spilled a glass of holy water
on her just to be sure.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.630
nothing.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.630
maybe she's just some
random wack job.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.860
if it had been an isolated
incident,maybe,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.560
but first the family,
now this?

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.230
i believe
in a lot of things.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.730
coincidence
ain't one of them.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.100
did you boys find anything
around here?

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.430
no sulfur,nothing.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.660
well,maybe something.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.660
see? i'm working.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.730
anything interesting?

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.060
i don't know yet.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.800
might just be a guy...

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.900
or it might be our guy.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.300
what time is it?

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.260
seven past midnight.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.900
you sure this is
the right place?
no.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.400
but i spent all day canvassing
this stupid town

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.660
with this guy's stupid mug,

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.130
and,supposedly,
he drinks at this stupid bar.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.330
that's not funny!

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.500
yeah.
uh,all right,so --

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.430
so,john doe's name
is walter rosen.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.360
he's from oak park,
just west of chicago.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.900
went missing
about a week ago.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.130
the night
the devil's gate opened?
yeah.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160
so you think
he's possessed?
it's a good bet.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.700
so,what,he just walks up
to someone,touches them,

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.400
and they go
stark raving psycho?

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.060
those demons that got out
at the gate --

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.360
they're gonna do all kinds
of things we haven't seen.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.960
you mean the demons
we let out?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
guys.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.060
all right. showtime.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.460
wait a minute.
what?

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.600
what did i just say?

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.960
we don't know what to expect
out of this guy.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.230
we should tail him
till we know for sure.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.400
oh,so he kills someone
and we just sit here?

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.100
we're no good dead!

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.100
and we're not gonna make
a move

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.700
until we know
what the score is.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.030
hey,bobby,i don't think
that's an option.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.160
why not?

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.160
damn it!

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.730
i mean,what do you think
you're doing here?

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.400
i don't like hunters
in my bar.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:16.360

into the wrong place.

one filthy finger on her!

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.780

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.280
okay,i understand that,
but we can't go back.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.780
fine. then you stay.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.310
but i'm heading back
to that bar.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.650
i'll go with her.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.810
it's suicide,dean!

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.480
so what?
i'm dead already!

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.380
how you gonna kill 'em?

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:33.680
you can't stab 'em.

they're not just gonna wait
in line to get exorcised!

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.150
i don't care!

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.510
we don't even know how many
of them there are!

yeah,we do.
there's seven.

who we're up against?

"binsfeld's classification
of demons."

not just as human vices
but as actual devils.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.080
the family --
they were touched by sloth.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.380
and the shopper...

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:20.710
that's envy's doing --

in the next room.

i couldn't suss it out at first
until isaac.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.810
he was touched
with an awful gluttony.

i don't give a rat's ass

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.580
if they're the three stooges
or the four tops!

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.610
i'm gonna slaughter
every last one of them!

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.580
we already did it your way.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.850
you burst in there half-cocked
and look what happened!

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.480
these demons haven't been
topside in half a millennium!

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.810
we're talking medieval,
dark ages!

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:48.510
we've never faced anything
close to this!

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.750
so we are gonna
take a breath...

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.580
and figure out
what our next move is!

we do.
we're not impressed.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:29.250
why are you here?
what are you after?

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.310
he asked you a question.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.310

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.080

what we want.

the first stone,huh?

what about you,dean?

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.810
you're practically
a walking billboard

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.050
of gluttony and lust.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.480
and,tamara,
all that wrath.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:02.050
ooh. tsk,tsk,tsk,
tsk,tsk,tsk,tsk.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.210
it's the reason you and isaac
became hunters

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.780
in the first place,
isn't it?

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.780
it's so much easier
to drink in the rage

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:13.750
than to face what really
happened all those years ago.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.110
aah!

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.150

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.650
my point exactly.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.350
and you call us sins.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.180
we're not sins,man.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.380
we are natural
human instinct.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.480
and you can repress and deny us
all you want,

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:39.780
but the truth is,
you are just animals.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.580

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.810
you'll be slaughtered
like animals,too.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.510

gonna find you...

to run that they won't find us.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:47.280
like that night those things
came to our house...

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.550
...came for our daughter!

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.080
you just let her die,too.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.750
you son of a bitch!

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.910
tamara,no!

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.380
you're not isaac!

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:30.880
fat,drunk,and stupid is no way
to go through life,son.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.650
exorcizamus te,omnis immundus
spiritus,omnis satanica...

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.080
i suppose you're lust.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.350
baby,i'm whatever
you want me to be.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.580
just stay back.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.750
or what?

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.680
good point.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.910
i'm not gonna hurt you --
not yet.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.910
not unless you want me to.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.450
here's johnny!

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.080
come on.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.810
you really think something
like that

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.510
is gonna fool someone
like me?

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.750
i mean,me?

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.780
let me guess --
you're pride.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:43.180
the root of all sin.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.180
and you...

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:47.610
are sam winchester.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.780
that's right.
i've heard of you.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:52.410
we've all heard of you.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:56.650
the prodigy,the boy king.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.010
looking at you now,
i got to tell you,

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.210
don't believe the hype.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.050
you think i'm gonna bow

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.280
to a cut-rate,
piss-poor human like you?

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:09.980
i have my pride, after all.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.980
and now with
your yellow-eyed friend dead,

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.210
i guess i don't really have
to do a damn thing,now,do i?

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:21.480
you're fair game now,boy,
and it's open season.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.510
you!

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.480
who the hell are you?

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:25.580
i'm the girl that just saved
your ass.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.580
well,i just
saved yours,too.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.510
[ chuckles ]
see you around,sam.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.210
wait!

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.230
sam: think she's gonna be
all right?

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.430
no. definitely not.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.430
well,you look like hell
warmed over.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.300
you try exorcising all night
and see how you feel.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:24.060
any survivors,bobby?

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.030
well,the pretty girl
and the heavy guy,

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.300
they'll make it.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.000
lifetime of therapy bills
ahead,but,still...

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.500
that's more than you can say
for these poor bastards.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.660
bobby,that knife --

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:38.460
what kind of blade
can kill a demon?

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.100
yesterday,i would have said
there was no such thing.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:44.130
i'm just gonna ask it again --
who was that masked chick?

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.960
actually,the more troubling
question would be,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.060
"how come a girl can fight
better than you?"

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.500
three demons,dean...
at once.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:54.100
hey,whatever it takes to get
you through the night,pal.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:55.960
yeah,well,if you want
a troubling question,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.130
i got one for you --

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.800
if we let out
the seven deadly sins,

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.130
what else did we let out?

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.200
you're right.
that is troubling.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.730
see you gents around.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.330
tamara?

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.560
the world just got
a lot scarier.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.430
be careful.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.460
you too.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.460
keep your eyes peeled
for omens.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.760
i'll do the same.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.160
you got it.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.000
wait,bobby.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:47.630
we can win this war,
right?

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.200
catch you
on the next one.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.700
so,where to?

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.330
uh,i don't know.
i was thinking louisiana maybe.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.030
little early for mardi gras,
isn't it?
yeah.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.330
listen,
i was talking to tamara,

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.860
and she mentioned
this hoodoo priestess

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.930
outside of shreveport that might
be able to help us out,

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.760
you know,with your --
with your demon deal.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.900
nah.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:35.830
"nah"?
what does that mean,"nah"?

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.960
sam,no hoodoo spell's
gonna break this deal.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.960
it's a goose chase.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.100
we don't know that.
yes,we do.

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:41.530
forget it.
she can't help.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.100
we're not going,
and that's that.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.930
what about reno,huh?

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.330
you know what?

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.760
i've had it.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.530
i've been bending over backwards
trying to be nice to you,

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.700
and...i don't care anymore.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:55.800
that didn't last long.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.200
yeah,well,you know what?

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.760
i've been busting my ass
trying to keep you alive,dean,

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.500
and you act like
you couldn't care less.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.500
what,you got some kind of
death wish or something?

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:04.660
it's not like that.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.760
then what's it like,dean?

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.900
sam --
please,tell me.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.600
we trap the crossroads demon,
trick it,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.830
try to welsh our way
out of the deal in any way,

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.860
you die,okay?

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.100
you die.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.630
those are the terms.
there's no way out of it.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.000
if you try to find a way,

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:24.960
so help me god,
i'm gonna stop you.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.200
[ sighs ]

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.730
how could you make
that deal,dean?

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.960
'cause i couldn't live
with you dead.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.160
couldn't do it.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.400
so,what,
now i live and you die?

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:39.760
that's the general idea,
yeah.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.330
yeah,well,
you're a hypocrite,dean.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.400
how did you feel when dad
sold his soul for you?

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:46.200
'cause i was there.
i remember.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.560
you were twisted and broken.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.300
and now you go and do
the same thing...to me.

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.230
what you did was selfish.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.600
yeah,you're right.
it was selfish.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:59.930
but i'm okay with that.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.660
i'm not.
tough.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.430
after everything i've done
for this family,

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.460
i think i'm entitled.

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:08.630
truth is,i'm tired,sam.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.000
i don't know,

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:12.200
it's like there's a light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:13.200
it's hellfire,dean.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.800
whatever.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:16.460
you're alive,
i feel good...

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.460
for the first time
in a long time.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.400
i got a year to live,sam.
i'd like to make the most of it.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.460
so what do you say we kill
some evil sons of bitches

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.400
and we raise
a little hell,huh?

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.930
you're unbelievable.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.660
very true.
