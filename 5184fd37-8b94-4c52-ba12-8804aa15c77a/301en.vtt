00:09.060 --> 00:10.460
dean:
look,dad's gone now.


00:10.500 --> 00:11.960
we have to carry out his legacy,


00:12.000 --> 00:14.360
and that means hunting down
as many evil sons of bitches


00:14.400 --> 00:16.030
as we possibly can.


00:19.900 --> 00:21.330
whoops.


01:14.500 --> 01:16.730
let me guess -- you're
offering up your own soul?


01:16.760 --> 01:18.130
all you got to do
is bring sam back.


01:18.160 --> 01:20.400
i'll give you one year
and one year only.


01:20.430 --> 01:23.360
if you try and weasel your way
out,then the deal is off.


01:25.760 --> 01:27.700
yellow-eyed demon:
how certain are you


01:27.730 --> 01:31.760
that what you brought back
is 100% pure sam?


01:38.500 --> 01:40.260
what the hell
just happened?


01:40.300 --> 01:43.260
that's a devil's gate,
a damn door to hell!


01:45.000 --> 01:47.100
hope to hell
you boys are ready


01:47.130 --> 01:48.800
'cause the war
has just begun.


04:52.060 --> 04:54.160
sam: hello.


04:54.200 --> 04:55.160
hey,sam.


04:55.200 --> 04:57.000
hey,bobby.
what you doing?


04:57.030 --> 04:58.430
oh,same old,same old.


04:58.460 --> 05:00.530
you buried
in that book again?


05:00.560 --> 05:04.360
sam,you want to break dean free
of that demon deal,


05:04.400 --> 05:06.660
you ain't gonna find the answer
in no book.


05:06.700 --> 05:07.960
then where,bobby?


05:08.000 --> 05:10.330
kid,i wish i knew.


05:10.360 --> 05:13.360
so,where's your brother?


05:13.400 --> 05:15.530
polling the electorate.
what?


05:15.560 --> 05:17.800
never mind.
well,you boys better
pack it up.


05:17.830 --> 05:20.030
i think i finally
found something.


05:20.060 --> 05:22.660
* she looked at me
with big brown eyes *
[ knock on door ]


05:22.700 --> 05:25.700
dean?
* and said,
"you ain't seen nothing yet" *


05:25.730 --> 05:27.630
dean,you -- you conscious?


05:27.660 --> 05:30.660
bobby called,
and he thinks that maybe we --


05:30.700 --> 05:32.430
oh,god.


05:37.730 --> 05:39.460
let me see your knife.


05:39.500 --> 05:40.760
what for?


05:40.800 --> 05:42.500
so i can gouge my eyes out.


05:43.860 --> 05:45.900
it was a beautiful,
natural act,sam.


05:45.930 --> 05:48.760
it's a part of you i never
wanted to see,dean.


05:50.160 --> 05:52.330
hey,i appreciate you giving me
a little quality time


05:52.360 --> 05:53.660
with the doublemint twins.


05:53.700 --> 05:55.960
no problem.


05:56.000 --> 05:57.360
really?


05:57.400 --> 05:58.860
well,i got to say,


05:58.900 --> 06:02.330
i was expecting a weary sigh
or an eye roll,something.


06:02.360 --> 06:04.360
not at all. you deserve
to have a little fun.


06:04.400 --> 06:07.230
well,i'm in violent agreement
with you there.


06:07.260 --> 06:09.960
[ chuckles ]
what's bobby got?
not much.


06:10.000 --> 06:12.330
crop failure and a cicada swarm
outside of lincoln,nebraska.


06:12.360 --> 06:14.030
could be demonic omens.


06:14.060 --> 06:16.830
or could just be a bad crop
and a bug problem.
but it's our only lead.


06:16.860 --> 06:19.760
any freaky deaths?
nothing bobby could find --
not yet,anyway.


06:19.800 --> 06:21.960
it's weird,man. the night
the devil's gate opened,


06:22.000 --> 06:23.460
all these weirdo
storm clouds


06:23.500 --> 06:24.760
were sighted
over how many cities?


06:24.800 --> 06:25.900
17.
17.


06:25.930 --> 06:27.560
you think it would be
"apocalypse now,"


06:27.600 --> 06:30.360
but it's been five days
and bubkes.


06:32.200 --> 06:33.500
what are the demons
waiting for?


06:33.530 --> 06:35.130
beats me.


06:35.160 --> 06:36.260
driving me crazy.


06:36.300 --> 06:37.730
i tell you,
if it's gonna be war,


06:37.760 --> 06:39.260
i wish it would just
start already.


06:39.300 --> 06:40.730
be careful
what you wish for.


06:56.300 --> 06:57.660
hear those cicadas?


06:57.700 --> 07:00.100
that can't be
a good sign.


07:00.130 --> 07:01.730
no. no,it can't.


07:05.760 --> 07:07.830
so,we're eating
bacon cheeseburgers


07:07.860 --> 07:09.630
for breakfast,are we?


07:09.660 --> 07:12.930
well,sold my soul.
got a year to live.


07:12.960 --> 07:15.530
i ain't sweating
the cholesterol.


07:15.560 --> 07:16.860
so,bobby,
what do you think?


07:16.900 --> 07:18.360
we got a biblical plague here
or what?


07:18.400 --> 07:19.830
well,let's find out.


07:19.860 --> 07:22.030
looks like the swarm's
ground zero.


07:23.960 --> 07:26.260
candygram!


07:42.060 --> 07:43.830
that's awful.


07:43.860 --> 07:46.130
that so can't be
a good sign.


08:19.060 --> 08:20.860
you hear that?


08:34.730 --> 08:36.830
this is supposed to be
my birthday party.


08:36.860 --> 08:37.930
oh,my god.


08:48.230 --> 08:52.360
grandma is making out
the invitation list.


08:52.400 --> 08:54.400
sue ellen is gonna hire...


08:54.430 --> 08:56.800
bobby,what the hell
happened here?
i don't know.


08:56.830 --> 08:58.160
and j.r.'s gonna use it...


08:58.200 --> 08:59.760
check for sulfur.


08:59.800 --> 09:01.500
...for one of his big deals!


09:01.530 --> 09:04.800
and now you're gonna buy
my clothes!


09:04.830 --> 09:07.700
i hate this family!


09:59.800 --> 10:02.600
bobby: isaac? tamara?


10:04.200 --> 10:05.260
[ british accent ]
bobby.


10:05.300 --> 10:06.600
what the hell are you
doing here?


10:06.630 --> 10:07.700
i could ask the same.


10:07.730 --> 10:09.430
heya,bobby.


10:09.460 --> 10:12.560
hello. bleeding here.


10:16.030 --> 10:18.360
bobby: isaac,you sure got
some nice digs here.


10:18.400 --> 10:20.000
yeah.
if i can find anything.


10:20.030 --> 10:23.860
honey...
where's the palo santo?


10:23.900 --> 10:25.400
well,where'd you leave it?


10:25.430 --> 10:28.400
i don't know,dear.
that's why i'm asking.


10:28.430 --> 10:29.860
palo santo?


10:29.900 --> 10:32.360
it's holy wood from peru.


10:32.400 --> 10:36.060
it's toxic to demons
like holy water.


10:36.100 --> 10:39.730
keeps the bastards nailed down
while you're exorcising them.


10:39.760 --> 10:41.330
thank you,dear.


10:41.360 --> 10:44.930
you'd lose your head
if it wasn't for me.


10:44.960 --> 10:47.200
so,how long you two
been married?


10:47.230 --> 10:49.230
eight years
this past june.


10:50.630 --> 10:52.230
the family
that slays together...


10:52.260 --> 10:53.700
right.
i'm with you there.


10:53.730 --> 10:55.030
so,how'd you get started?


11:01.330 --> 11:03.630
oh,you know...
i'm sorry.


11:03.660 --> 11:06.060
it's not --
that's none of my business.


11:06.100 --> 11:07.930
it's -- it's all right.


11:07.960 --> 11:11.700
well,jenny,if you look
as pretty as you sound,


11:11.730 --> 11:15.400
then i'd love to have
an appletini.


11:15.430 --> 11:17.060
yeah. call you.


11:17.100 --> 11:19.960
that was
the coroner's tech.
and?


11:20.000 --> 11:22.800
get this -- that whole family,
'cause of death --


11:22.830 --> 11:24.730
dehydration and starvation.


11:24.760 --> 11:27.060
there's no signs of restraint,
no violence,no struggle.


11:27.100 --> 11:28.700
they just sat down
and never got up.


11:28.730 --> 11:30.960
but there was a fully stocked
kitchen just yards away.


11:31.000 --> 11:32.360
what is this,
a demon attack?


11:32.400 --> 11:34.630
if it is,it's not like
anything i ever saw,


11:34.660 --> 11:35.730
and i've seen plenty.


11:35.760 --> 11:37.530
what now?
what should we do?


11:37.560 --> 11:39.400
uh,we're not gonna
do anything.


11:39.430 --> 11:40.600
what do you mean?


11:40.630 --> 11:41.830
you guys seem nice enough,


11:41.860 --> 11:43.300
but this ain't
"scooby-doo,"


11:43.330 --> 11:45.030
and we don't play well
with others.


11:45.060 --> 11:47.530
we'd cover a lot more ground
if we all worked together.


11:47.560 --> 11:49.800
no offense,but we're not
teaming with the damn fools


11:49.830 --> 11:52.130
who let the devil's gate
get open in the first place.


11:52.160 --> 11:53.930
no offense?


11:53.960 --> 11:56.160
isaac,like you've never made
a mistake.


11:56.200 --> 11:59.130
yeah,locked my keys in the car,
turned my laundry pink.


11:59.160 --> 12:01.630
never brought on the end
of the world,though.


12:01.660 --> 12:03.230
[ chuckles ]
all right. that's enough.


12:03.260 --> 12:04.830
guys,this isn't helping.
dean --


12:04.860 --> 12:07.830
look,there are couple hundred
more demons out there now.


12:07.860 --> 12:10.060
we don't know where they are,
when they'll strike.


12:10.100 --> 12:12.100
there ain't enough hunters
in the world


12:12.130 --> 12:13.760
to handle something
like this.


12:13.800 --> 12:16.730
you brought war down on us --
on all of us.


12:16.760 --> 12:19.930
okay. that's quite enough
testosterone for now.


13:15.430 --> 13:17.030
excuse me.


13:17.060 --> 13:18.030
yes?


13:19.900 --> 13:21.960
those are...nice shoes.


13:23.560 --> 13:26.800
oh,yeah.
they are nice.


13:33.460 --> 13:34.960
those are nice shoes.


13:35.000 --> 13:36.630
aren't they?


13:37.960 --> 13:39.260
i want them.


13:39.300 --> 13:40.800
sorry. last pair.


13:50.430 --> 13:52.700
excuse me.


13:52.730 --> 13:53.860
i want those shoes.


13:53.900 --> 13:57.430
what,are you crazy?
no. what?


14:30.460 --> 14:33.500
dean: what happened outside
makes you realize


14:32.630 --> 14:33.900
how fragile life really is.


14:33.930 --> 14:37.000
you got to make
every second count.


14:38.700 --> 14:40.430
excuse me a minute,
would you?


14:40.460 --> 14:41.430
sure.


14:42.760 --> 14:44.130
dean,what are you doing?


14:44.160 --> 14:46.000
i'm comforting
the bereaved.


14:46.030 --> 14:47.100
what are you doing?


14:47.130 --> 14:48.130
working.


14:48.160 --> 14:50.160
dead body,
possible demon attack --


14:50.200 --> 14:51.330
that kind of stuff.


14:51.360 --> 14:52.760
sam,i'm sorry.


14:52.800 --> 14:55.130
it's just i don't have
much time left,and...


14:56.330 --> 14:58.700
...got to make
every second count.


14:58.730 --> 15:00.930
yeah,right. sorry.


15:00.960 --> 15:02.360
apology accepted.


15:02.400 --> 15:04.930
whoa. [ whistles ]
looking spiffy,bobby.


15:04.960 --> 15:06.360
what were you,a g-man?


15:06.400 --> 15:08.360
attorney
for the d.a.'s office.


15:08.400 --> 15:10.100
i just spoke
to the suspect.


15:10.130 --> 15:12.830
yeah? so,what do you think?
is she possessed or what?


15:12.860 --> 15:14.060
don't think so.


15:14.100 --> 15:15.860
there's none
of the usual signs --


15:15.900 --> 15:18.530
no blackouts,
no loss of control.


15:18.560 --> 15:20.030
totally lucid.


15:20.060 --> 15:22.760
just,she really wanted
those shoes.


15:22.800 --> 15:25.900
spilled a glass of holy water
on her just to be sure.


15:25.930 --> 15:27.530
nothing.


15:27.560 --> 15:29.530
maybe she's just some
random wack job.


15:29.560 --> 15:31.760
if it had been an isolated
incident,maybe,


15:31.800 --> 15:33.460
but first the family,
now this?


15:33.500 --> 15:35.130
i believe
in a lot of things.


15:35.160 --> 15:36.630
coincidence
ain't one of them.


15:36.660 --> 15:39.000
did you boys find anything
around here?


15:39.030 --> 15:40.330
no sulfur,nothing.


15:40.360 --> 15:42.560
well,maybe something.


15:45.960 --> 15:48.560
see? i'm working.


15:49.900 --> 15:51.630
anything interesting?


15:51.660 --> 15:52.960
i don't know yet.


15:53.000 --> 15:54.700
might just be a guy...


15:54.730 --> 15:56.800
or it might be our guy.


16:34.860 --> 16:37.200
what time is it?


16:37.230 --> 16:39.160
seven past midnight.


16:40.460 --> 16:42.800
you sure this is
the right place?
no.


16:42.830 --> 16:45.300
but i spent all day canvassing
this stupid town


16:45.330 --> 16:47.560
with this guy's stupid mug,


16:47.600 --> 16:51.030
and,supposedly,
he drinks at this stupid bar.


16:54.030 --> 16:55.230
that's not funny!


16:55.260 --> 16:58.400
yeah.
uh,all right,so --


16:58.430 --> 17:01.330
so,john doe's name
is walter rosen.


17:01.360 --> 17:03.260
he's from oak park,
just west of chicago.


17:03.300 --> 17:04.800
went missing
about a week ago.


17:04.830 --> 17:07.030
the night
the devil's gate opened?
yeah.


17:07.060 --> 17:09.060
so you think
he's possessed?
it's a good bet.


17:09.100 --> 17:11.600
so,what,he just walks up
to someone,touches them,


17:11.630 --> 17:13.300
and they go
stark raving psycho?


17:13.330 --> 17:14.960
those demons that got out
at the gate --


17:15.000 --> 17:17.260
they're gonna do all kinds
of things we haven't seen.


17:17.300 --> 17:18.860
you mean the demons
we let out?


17:18.900 --> 17:20.900
guys.


17:24.930 --> 17:26.960
all right. showtime.


17:27.000 --> 17:28.360
wait a minute.
what?


17:28.400 --> 17:29.500
what did i just say?


17:29.530 --> 17:31.860
we don't know what to expect
out of this guy.


17:31.900 --> 17:34.130
we should tail him
till we know for sure.


17:34.160 --> 17:36.300
oh,so he kills someone
and we just sit here?


17:36.330 --> 17:38.000
we're no good dead!


17:38.030 --> 17:40.000
and we're not gonna make
a move


17:40.030 --> 17:41.600
until we know
what the score is.


17:41.630 --> 17:43.930
hey,bobby,i don't think
that's an option.


17:43.960 --> 17:45.060
why not?


17:52.000 --> 17:53.060
damn it!


18:01.730 --> 18:02.760
thanks.


18:02.800 --> 18:03.930
you're welcome.


18:27.200 --> 18:29.800
pull the car in back.


18:29.830 --> 18:32.500
we'll be right out.


18:32.530 --> 18:34.730

no.


18:48.300 --> 18:52.630
i mean,what do you think
you're doing here?


18:55.160 --> 18:58.300
i don't like hunters
in my bar.

i can think of about a thousand
things i'd like to do to her.

you're not gonna lay
one filthy finger on her!


19:39.380 --> 19:40.880

i'm dead already!


21:37.610 --> 21:40.480
how you gonna kill 'em?
can't shoot 'em.


21:40.510 --> 21:41.780
you can't stab 'em.


21:41.810 --> 21:44.010
they're not just gonna wait
in line to get exorcised!


21:44.050 --> 21:45.250
i don't care!


21:45.280 --> 21:47.610
we don't even know how many
of them there are!

yeah,we do.
there's seven.

who we're up against?

no. who?

the seven deadly sins,

"binsfeld's classification
of demons."

not just as human vices
but as actual devils.

they were touched by sloth.

that's envy's doing --

22:53.950 --> 22:56.610
we've never faced anything
close to this!


22:56.650 --> 22:58.850
so we are gonna
take a breath...


22:58.880 --> 23:01.680
and figure out
what our next move is!

the first stone,huh?


24:56.980 --> 24:58.980
what about you,dean?


24:59.010 --> 25:01.910
you're practically
a walking billboard


25:01.950 --> 25:04.150
of gluttony and lust.


25:04.180 --> 25:07.580
and,tamara,
all that wrath.


25:07.610 --> 25:10.150
ooh. tsk,tsk,tsk,
tsk,tsk,tsk,tsk.


25:10.180 --> 25:12.310
it's the reason you and isaac
became hunters


25:12.350 --> 25:13.880
in the first place,
isn't it?


25:13.910 --> 25:17.880
it's so much easier
to drink in the rage


25:17.910 --> 25:21.850
than to face what really
happened all those years ago.


25:21.880 --> 25:23.210
aah!


25:24.280 --> 25:25.250
whew!


25:25.280 --> 25:27.580
[ laughs ]


25:30.850 --> 25:32.750
my point exactly.


25:32.780 --> 25:35.450
and you call us sins.


25:35.480 --> 25:37.280
we're not sins,man.


25:37.310 --> 25:40.480
we are natural
human instinct.


25:40.480 --> 25:43.580
and you can repress and deny us
all you want,


25:43.610 --> 25:47.880
but the truth is,
you are just animals.


25:49.180 --> 25:50.680
horny...


25:50.710 --> 25:52.580
greedy...


25:52.610 --> 25:54.410
hungry...

...violent animals.


25:57.480 --> 25:59.250
and you know what?


25:59.280 --> 26:01.910
you'll be slaughtered
like animals,too.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.750
they're coming for me.


26:12.780 --> 26:14.610

26:16.780 --> 26:19.110
but they're not
gonna find you...

'cause you'll be in hell.

i don't think we're gonna have
to worry about hunting them.


26:46.010 --> 26:47.280
what does that mean?


26:47.310 --> 26:49.380
i think maybe
this joker's right.


26:49.410 --> 26:50.910
they're gonna be
hunting us.

quit easy.

to run that they won't find us.

back there.


29:27.810 --> 29:29.380
how could you do that?


29:29.410 --> 29:32.380
we swore...

at that lake in michigan.


29:34.580 --> 29:35.950

we swore we would never
leave each other!

let me die?!

you do,dear!

looking at you now,
i got to tell you,


32:09.450 --> 32:12.610
don't believe the hype.

warmed over.

and see how you feel.

well,the pretty girl
and the heavy guy,

ahead,but,still...

for these poor bastards.

bobby,that knife --


34:52.200 --> 34:53.960
what kind of blade
can kill a demon?


34:53.000 --> 34:56.600
yesterday,i would have said
there was no such thing.


34:56.630 --> 34:59.630
i'm just gonna ask it again --
who was that masked chick?


34:59.660 --> 35:01.460
actually,the more troubling
question would be,


35:01.500 --> 35:03.560
"how come a girl can fight
better than you?"


35:03.600 --> 35:05.000
three demons,dean...
at once.

hey,whatever it takes to get
you through the night,pal.


35:09.630 --> 35:11.460
yeah,well,if you want
a troubling question,


35:11.500 --> 35:12.630
i got one for you --


35:12.660 --> 35:14.300
if we let out
the seven deadly sins,


35:14.330 --> 35:16.630
what else did we let out?


35:18.760 --> 35:20.700
you're right.
that is troubling.


35:31.860 --> 35:34.230
see you gents around.


35:34.260 --> 35:35.830
tamara?


35:37.930 --> 35:40.060

a lot scarier.


35:40.100 --> 35:42.930
be careful.


35:42.960 --> 35:44.960
you too.


35:51.260 --> 35:53.960
keep your eyes peeled
for omens.


35:53.000 --> 35:55.260
i'll do the same.


35:55.300 --> 35:56.660
you got it.


35:56.700 --> 35:58.500
wait,bobby.


36:00.430 --> 36:03.130

right?


36:11.660 --> 36:13.700

on the next one.


36:28.600 --> 36:30.200
so,where to?


36:31.000 --> 36:35.830
uh,i don't know.
i was thinking louisiana maybe.


36:35.860 --> 36:38.530
little early for mardi gras,
isn't it?
yeah.


36:38.560 --> 36:39.830
listen,
i was talking to tamara,


36:39.860 --> 36:41.360
and she mentioned
this hoodoo priestess


36:41.400 --> 36:43.430
outside of shreveport that might
be able to help us out,


36:43.460 --> 36:46.260
you know,with your --
with your demon deal.


36:46.300 --> 36:48.400
nah.


36:48.430 --> 36:51.330
"nah"?
what does that mean,"nah"?


36:51.360 --> 36:53.460
sam,no hoodoo spell's
gonna break this deal.


36:53.500 --> 36:54.460
it's a goose chase.


36:54.500 --> 36:55.600
we don't know that.
yes,we do.


36:55.630 --> 36:57.030
forget it.
she can't help.


36:57.060 --> 36:59.600
we're not going,
and that's that.


36:59.630 --> 37:01.430
what about reno,huh?


37:01.460 --> 37:03.830
you know what?


37:03.860 --> 37:05.260
i've had it.


37:05.300 --> 37:08.030
i've been bending over backwards
trying to be nice to you,


37:08.060 --> 37:10.200
and...i don't care anymore.


37:10.230 --> 37:11.300
that didn't last long.


37:11.330 --> 37:12.700
yeah,well,you know what?


37:12.730 --> 37:15.260
i've been busting my ass
trying to keep you alive,dean,


37:15.300 --> 37:16.000
and you act like
you couldn't care less.


37:17.030 --> 37:18.000
what,you got some kind of
death wish or something?


37:19.030 --> 37:20.160
it's not like that.


37:20.200 --> 37:21.260
then what's it like,dean?


37:21.300 --> 37:22.400
sam --
please,tell me.


37:25.160 --> 37:28.100
we trap the crossroads demon,
trick it,


37:28.130 --> 37:30.330
try to welsh our way
out of the deal in any way,


37:30.360 --> 37:33.360
you die,okay?


37:33.400 --> 37:34.600
you die.


37:34.630 --> 37:37.130
those are the terms.
there's no way out of it.


37:37.160 --> 37:38.500
if you try to find a way,


37:38.530 --> 37:40.460
so help me god,
i'm gonna stop you.


37:44.400 --> 37:45.700
[ sighs ]


37:45.730 --> 37:47.230
how could you make
that deal,dean?


37:48.600 --> 37:50.460
'cause i couldn't live
with you dead.


37:50.500 --> 37:51.660
couldn't do it.


37:51.700 --> 37:53.900
so,what,
now i live and you die?


37:53.930 --> 37:55.260
that's the general idea,
yeah.


37:55.300 --> 37:57.830
yeah,well,
you're a hypocrite,dean.


37:57.860 --> 37:59.900
how did you feel when dad
sold his soul for you?


37:59.930 --> 38:01.700
'cause i was there.
i remember.


38:01.730 --> 38:04.060
you were twisted and broken.


38:04.100 --> 38:08.800
and now you go and do
the same thing...to me.


38:08.830 --> 38:10.730
what you did was selfish.


38:10.760 --> 38:14.100
yeah,you're right.
it was selfish.


38:14.130 --> 38:15.430
but i'm okay with that.


38:15.460 --> 38:17.160
i'm not.
tough.


38:17.200 --> 38:18.930
after everything i've done
for this family,


38:18.960 --> 38:19.960
i think i'm entitled.


38:21.330 --> 38:24.130
truth is,i'm tired,sam.


38:24.160 --> 38:25.500
i don't know,


38:25.530 --> 38:27.700
it's like there's a light
at the end of the tunnel.


38:27.730 --> 38:28.700
it's hellfire,dean.


38:28.730 --> 38:30.300
whatever.


38:30.330 --> 38:31.960
you're alive,
i feel good...


38:31.000 --> 38:34.960
for the first time
in a long time.


38:34.000 --> 38:38.900
i got a year to live,sam.
i'd like to make the most of it.


38:38.930 --> 38:40.960
so what do you say we kill
some evil sons of bitches


38:40.000 --> 38:42.900
and we raise
a little hell,huh?


38:46.100 --> 38:48.430
you're unbelievable.


38:48.460 --> 38:51.160
very true.
