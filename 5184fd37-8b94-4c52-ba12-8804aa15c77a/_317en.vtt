The Road So Far

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.700
Let me guess, you are oferring your own soul?

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.400
All you got to do is bringing Sam back

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.400
- How long have you get
- one year

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.200
Let Dean out of this deal right now

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.700
I got a boss like everybody

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.900
Who holds the contract?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.600
I can't tell you.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.000
There is a new leader rising in the west

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.700
doesn't like you very much.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400
Her name is Lilith

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.600
- I know about your deal, Dean.
- Who told you that?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.300
The demon that holds it.
She holds mine, too.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.000
- She?
- Her name's Lilith.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So, this is Ruby, huh?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.900
She's a demon, Sam.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.900
They want us dead.
We want them dead.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.600
what kind of blade could kill a demon?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.300
yesterday, i'd have said
There was no such thing.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.300
Yellow eyes had some
Pretty big plans for you, Sam.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.600
You're specialn that
E.s.p.-vision kind of way.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.400
No, that stuff's
Not happening anymore.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
Black dogs? They're seeing
Hellhounds -- demonic pit bulls.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
- There's no way of saving me, is there?
- No.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.300
I don't want to die.I don't wanna go to hell.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.500
We will find a way to save you.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.400
You're gonna die!
This is what you're gonna become!

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600
now

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.500
(hellhounds)

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500
Dig up anything good?

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.100
No. Nothing good.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.900
Well, Bobby has, finally.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.200
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.500
A way to find Lilith.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.600
Wow. With just, uh, 30 hours to go.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.500
Hey, why don't we just make
A t.j. Run, you know?

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.900
Some seÑOritas, cervezas?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.900
We could -- what's spanish
For "donkey show"?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.400
So, if we do save you...

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.000
Let's never do that.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.900
Hey, hey, Dean...

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.500
Look, we're cuttinit cse,I know.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.300
But we are gonna get this done.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.300
I don't care What it take

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.000
You are not gonna go to hell.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.700
I'm not gonna let you.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.000
I swear.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.400

So, you got a name?

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.600
That's the whole kit and caboodle.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.100
With the right name,The right ritual,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.700
Ain't nothing You can't suss out.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.200
Like the town Lilith in?

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.200
When I get it done. We will know it straight.

And we have a winner.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.500
All right. Let's go

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.900
whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold on.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.700
Just holster it up, There, tex.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.000
- What's the problem?
- "what's the problem"?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.700
Come on, where do i begin?

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.300
I mean, first of all,We don't even know
if Lilith actually holds my deal.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.600
We are going off Ofela's intel?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.000
Now, when that bit
The air comes out crooked, okay

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.400
Second, even if we could
Get to Lilith, we have to gank her.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.400
And third, isn't this the same Lilith
that wants your giayoon a pike?

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.600
Should i continue?

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.500
Ain't you just bringing down the room?

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.600
- Well, it's a gift.
- I'm sorry.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.000
So, then, what are we
Supposed to do, Dean?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.600
Well, just 'cause i got to die
Doesn't mean you have to, okay?

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.500
Either we go in smart
Or we don't go in at all.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.400
Okay, fine.That's the case,
I have the answer.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400
- You do?
- Yeah.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.200
A surefire way to confirm it's Lilith

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.200
And a way to get us
A bona fide demon-killing ginsu.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.500
Damn it, Sam, no.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.200
We are so past arguing.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.600
Dean, i am summoning Ruby.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.400
The hell you are!
We got enough problems as it is.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.300
Exactly. And we got no time
And no choice, either.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.900
Come on, man, she is the miss universe
Of lying skanks, okay?

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.700
She told you that she could
Save me, huh? Lie!

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.300
She seems know everything about Lilith

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.700
But forgot to mention --
oh,Right -- Lilith owns my soul!

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.900
Okay, fine, she's a liar.
She's still got that knife.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.400
- Dean?
- For all we know,she works for Lilith.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.500
Give me another option Dean.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.900
- Tell me what else
- Sam is right.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.600
No! Damn it!

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.000
Just no.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.400
We are not gonna make the same
Mistakes all over again.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.000
You guys want to save me,
Find something else.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Where you going, Bobby?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.200
I guess to...

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Find something else

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.000
Ad constringendum,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.700
Ad ligandum eos pariter Et solvendum.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:03.200
Et ad congregantum eos coram me.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.100
You know, Phones work, too.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.900
Hey, Sam.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.800
How's tricks?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.100
How do you get around so fast?

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.100
I got the super bowl jetpack.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.900
So...

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.700
You called?

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.400
Did you know?

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.200
I'm gonna need a tiny bit more.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.800
About Dean's deal --
That Lilith holds the contract.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.100
Yes. I did.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.900
And, what, you didn't think that was important?

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.100
- You weren't ready.
- For what?

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.000
If i told you,you two yahoos

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.100
Would have just charged
After her half-cocked,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.600
And Lilith would have peeled the meat

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.100
From your pretty, pretty faces.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.000
Well, we're ready now.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.700
I want your knife.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.800
You're right about one thing.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.300
You are ready.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.800
And now's the time, too

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.800
Lilith's guard's down.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.000
Is that so?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
She's on shore leave,
A little r&r.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.100
What the hell does that ?

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.100
Trust me. You don't wanna know.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.500
You didn't lose
Those hex bags i gave you?

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.500
- We got 'em.
-Good. Then she won't sense you're coming.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.200
So, you'll give us the knife?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.000
No.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.300
But you just said --

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.300
You want to charge in
With one little pigsticker?

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.200
It's a waste of a true-blue window,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.600
Like hitting hitler
With that exploding briefcase -- forget it.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.600
Ok, then how?

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.300
I know you wanna save your brother, Sam.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.700
No, you don't.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.900
You told Dean you couldn't.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.600
You have been lying to me all along!

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600
So, just give me your damn knife!

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.900
You're not the one that i've been lying to.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.900
- Oh, so you can save him?
- No.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.700
But you can.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.600
What?

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.600
Sam, you've got some god-given talent.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.600
Well, not god given,
But you get the gist.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.800
All that psychic crap?

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.300
That's gone ever since
Yellow eyes died.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.900
Not gone.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.800
Dormant.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.100
And not just visions,either.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.100
Why do you think Lilith is so scared of you?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.600
Right, she's scared of me.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.500
If you wanted, you could wipe her off the map
Without moving a muscle.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.200
- I don't believe you.
- It's the truth.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.600
And you decided to tell me this just now?

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.000
Um...demon.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
"manipulative" is kind of
In the job description.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.000
The fact is, is that you never
Would have considered it,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
- Not until you were --
- Desperate enough?

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.300
You don't like being different.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.800
You hate the way Dean
Looks at you sometimes,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.800
Like you're some sort of sideshow freak.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.000
But suck it up because we got
A lot of ground to cover,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.200
And we got to do it fast.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.700
But we can do it.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.000
Look,call me a bitch and hate me if you want.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But i have never lied to you, Sam.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.000
Not ever.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.800
And i'telling you --

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.100
You can save your brother.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.200
And i can show you how.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.700
So, that's you, huh?

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.100
Our slutty little yoda.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.000
Dean.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.600
Charming as ever.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.900
Oh, i knew you'd show up...

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.900
'Cause i knew Sam wouldn't listen!

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.900
But you're not gonna
Teach him anything.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.000
You understand me?
Over my dead body.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.400
Oh. Well, you're right about that.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.700
What you are gonna do
Is give me that knife.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.700
Then you can go crawl back
Into whatever slop you came from

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.100
And never bother me
Or my brother again.Are we clear?

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.000
Your brother is carrying
A bomb inside of him,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.900
And we'd be stupid not to use it.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:53.700
Dean, look,Just hold on --

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.200
Sam, don't. Come on, man.
What are you, blind?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.500
Can't you see That this is a trick?

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.100
- That's not true.
- She wants you to givin

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.500
To this whole demonic,
Psychic whatever, okay?

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.400
Hell, she probably Wants you to
become her little "antichrist superstar."

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.400
I want Lilith dead.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.400
- That's all.
- Why?

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.600
I've told you why.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.800
Oh, right, yeah.Because you were human once,

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.500
And you liked kittens
And long walks on the beach.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.300
You know, i am so sick
Of proving myself to you.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.300
You want to save yourself,
This is how,

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.000
You dumb, spineless dick!

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.600
Whoa! Ruby, hey!

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.700
What the hell are you grinning at?

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.000
Missing something?

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.500
I'll kill you,You son of a bitch.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.200
Like i said...

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.000
I knew you'd come.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.000
Wait!

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.800
You're just gonna leave me here?

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.100
Let's go, Sam.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.400
Oh, so, you're just too stupid
To live, is that it?

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.300
Then fine.You deserve hell.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.900
I wish i could be there, Dean.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.500
I wish i could smell the flesh
Sizzle off your bones!

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.100
I wish i could be there
To hear you scream!

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.000
And i wish you'd
Shut your piehole,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.500
But we don't always get what we want.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.200
What, you gonna let Ruby
Rot down there?

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.200
That's the idea.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.200
Dean, what if, uh...

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.700
what if Ruby is right?

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.800
What if i can take Lilith

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.800
Quit looking at me like that.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.200
What, are you goe Her the "carrie" stare,
And Lilith goes poof?

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.300
I don't know what Ruby meant.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.000
you know, maybe we should just go and ask her

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.700
Sam, you wanted the knife.
I got you the knife.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.200
Dean, just listen to me for a second.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.600
Last time, Lilith snapped her fingers

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.900
And put 30 demons on our ass,
and all we got's one little knife?

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.800
I mean, like you said, we go in
Smart or we don't go in at all.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.700
Well, this ain't smart.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.800
We got one shot at this, Dean --
Just one.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.700
So, if there's A surefire way,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.800
They maybe we should Just talk about it.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.300
Sam, we are not gonna make
The same mistake all over again.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.000
You said that,
But what does that even mean?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.300
Don't you see a pattern here?

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.900
Dad's deal,My deal, now this?

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.400
Every time one of us is up to the crick
The other is begging to sell their soul

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.400
That's all this is, man.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.800
Ruby's jrut jerking your chain down the road.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.600
You know what's it's paved with,
And you know where it's going.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.600
Dean.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.500
What are you afraid's gonna happen?

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.700
This is me.I can handle it.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.100
And if it'll save you --

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.500
Why even risk it?

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.000
Because you're my brother.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.600
Because you did the same thing for me.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.100
i know.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.500
And look how that turned out.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.300
All i'm saying...

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.300
Sammy, all i'm saying is
That you're my weak pot

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.000
You are.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.700
And i'm yours.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.000
You don't mean that.
We're -- we're family.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I know.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.900
And those evil son
Of bitches know it, too.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.300
I mean, what we'll do For each other,
you know, How far we will go --

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.000
They're using that against us.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So, what, we just stop
Looking out for each other?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.900
no. we stop Being martyrs, man.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.600
We stop spreading it for these demons.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.600
Take this knife.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.000
And we go after Lilith our way,
The way dad taught us to.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.400
Ane go down,Then, uh...

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.800
Then we go down swinging.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.500
What do you think?

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.200
I think you totally should have
been jam"eye of the tiger"there.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.500
Oh, bite me.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.000
I totally rehearsed That s bitch too.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.600
So, Indiana, huh?

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.900
Yeah, where Lilith iIs on shore leave.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Yeah, i guess.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.300
Tell me something --

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.900

How'd you know?

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.300

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.200
Dean!

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.200
What the hell happened?

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.200
Dean just killed a demon.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.800
How'd you know?

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.800
I just knew.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.500
I could see its face,
Its real face under that one.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.900
so what? now you are seeing demons?

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.900
I am seeing all kinds of things lately,
but nothing like this.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.800
Actually, it's not all that crazy.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.800
how is It not that crazy?

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.800
Well, you got just
Over five hours to go

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.300

Glimpsing the "b" side.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.600
Little less new agey,Please.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.600

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.500
Thank you.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.000
It'll actually come in pretty handy.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.100
I am glad my doomed soul is good at something

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.400

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.000
Lilith's pbably got
Demons stashed all over town.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.800
We can't let 'em sound the alarm.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.900
If she knows we're here,
We're dead before we started.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.500
Wow, this is a terrif plan.
