1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,199
Look, dad's gone now.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,899
We have to carry out his legacy,

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,399
And that means hunting down as many
evil sons of bitches as we possibly can.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,499
Did I die?

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,199
Did you sell your soul for me?

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
How long do you get?

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,200
One year.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,500
You shouldn't have done that.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,700
I guess I got to save your ass
for a change.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What kind of blade
can kill a demon?

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,199
Yesterday, I would have
said there was no such thing.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,600
Who was that masked chick?

13
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,599
You ever run across a guy
named Gordon Walker?

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,199
He is dangerous to everyone
and everything around him.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,199
This demon tells me
they have soldiers

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,999
to fight in this coming war

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,899
humans fighting on hell's side.

18
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,899
I know about Sam's visions.

19
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,199
I know everything,
and your brother's fair game.

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,100
Aaah!

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,899
Gordon should be reaching for the soap
for the next few years, at least.

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,500
Tell me who you are!

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,899
You're a demon.

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,699
I'm here

25
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,899
because I want to help you.

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,299
What could you possibly...

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,300
I can help you
save your brother.

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,325
<font color="#4096d1">Supernatural 3x03 Bad day at Black Rock
==ragbear.com==</font>

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
It's true.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,300
The devil's gate
was opened in Wyoming.

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
Big...

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,500
St. Helens big.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,800
There's no solid fix
on how many demons got out,

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,800
but it's in the hundreds...
an army.

35
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,800
Sam Winchester was there,

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,800
wasn't he?

37
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,499
Talked to a guy who knows guy
who knows Bobby Singer,

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,099
and, yeah, looks like the
Winchesters were at ground zero

39
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,500
when the gate was popped.

40
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,399
But singer said
they went in there to stop it.

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
mnh-mnh.

42
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500
Bobby's edge ain't what it used to be.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,699
Sam could have him believing
anything by now.

44
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,699
Listen, Gordon.

45
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,199
As far as talk goes,

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,800
Sam Winchester checks out.

47
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,999
He's a hunter. That's all.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
That's all?

49
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,600
Kubrick...

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,100
I'm not even sure he's human.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Think I'm crazy?

52
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,399
I told you there was a war coming

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,500
six months ago.

54
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,200
Take a look around.

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,900
It's here.

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,700
Now I'm telling you this boy
is a part of it.

57
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,300
Track him down, Kubrick.

58
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,300
You'll come to see it, too.

59
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,200
Sam Winchester must die.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,399
Because demon, that's why.

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,699
I mean, the second you find out
this ruby chick is a demon,

62
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,999
You go for the holy water.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,199
- You don't chat.
- No one was chatting, Dean.

64
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,099
Oh, yeah? Then why didn't
you send her ass back to hell?

65
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,899
Because... Because she said she
might be able to help us out.

66
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,700
How?

67
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,799
Oh, really, Sam? How?
How could she possibly help us?

68
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
She told me she could help you, okay?

69
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,100
Help you out of the crossroads deal.

70
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,699
What's wrong with you? She's lying.

71
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,300
You got to know that, don't you?

72
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,500
She knows what your weakness is.
It's me.

73
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,900
What else did she say?

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,700
- Dude?
- Nothing.

75
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,700
Nothing, okay?!

76
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,199
Look, I'm not an idiot, Dean.

77
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,800
I'm not talking about trusting her.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,700
I'm talking about using her.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,300
I mean, we're at war, right?

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,999
And we don't know Jack about the enemy.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,999
We don't know where they are.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,299
We don't know what they're doing.

83
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
Hell, we don't even know what they want.

84
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,199
Now, this Ruby girl

85
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,700
knows more than we will
ever find out on our own.

86
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,399
Now, yes, it's a risk. I know that.

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,700
But we need to take it.

88
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,299
You're okay, right?
I mean, you're feeling okay?

89
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,100
Yes, I'm fine! Why are you
always asking me that?

90
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,800
It's not mine.

91
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,800
Nope.

92
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,499
Check the glove compartment.
It's dad's.

93
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,499
- Dad's?
- Yes.

94
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,900
I keep it charged in case
any of his old contacts call.

95
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,000
Hello?

96
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,700
Yes, this is Edgar Casey.

97
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,400
No, no, no, no. Don't... don't call the 
police. I'll handle this myself.

98
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,099
Thanks.

99
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,100
You know, can you just...
can you just lock it back up for me?

100
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,700
Great.

101
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,799
Uh, I... I don't have my...
my book in front of me.

102
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,100
Do you... do you have
the address so I can...

103
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,700
Sure. Okay.

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,900
Go ahead.

105
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,999
Right.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,900
Thanks a lot.

107
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,699
Dad ever tell you he kept a container
at a storage place?

108
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
- What?
- Outside of Buffalo.

109
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,899
No way.

110
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,699
Yeah.

111
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,300
And someone just broke into it.

112
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,800
So, you've got no hard evidence
on this Winchester guy?

113
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,200
You're just working off
Gordon's instincts.

114
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,700
You ever hunt with Gordon?

115
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,700
No. I heard he's good.

116
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
Good?

117
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,599
He's the best.

118
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,700
Saved my ass more times
than I can count.

119
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,600
So, if he says
Sam Winchester's dangerous,

120
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,099
I believe him.

121
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,800
He's gonna be covering his tracks.

122
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,100
Won't be easy to find.

123
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,399
Last I got puts him in Nebraska
three weeks back.

124
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,700
Not exactly a fresh lead.

125
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,599
He ain't invisible, creedie.

126
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,400
Some hunter out there knows something.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,100
So we start calling our contacts.

128
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,700
All we need is one break.

129
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,100
Don't play with my Jesus.

130
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Man.

131
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
What?

132
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
Just dad. You know, him and his secrets.

133
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,399
We spent all this time with this guy,

134
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,799
and it's like we barely even 
know the man.

135
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,000
Well, we're about to learn something.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
No demons allowed.

137
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Blood.

138
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
Check this out.

139
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,400
Whoever broke in here got attacked.

140
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
Dear, old dad.

141
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,799
I got two sets of boot tracks.

142
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,900
It looks like it was a two-man job.

143
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,099
And our friend with the buckshot 
in him...

144
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,800
It looks like he kept walking.

145
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,399
So, what's the deal?

146
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,100
Dad would do work here or something?

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,900
Living the high life, as usual.

148
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,599
1995.

149
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
No way!

150
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,200
That's my division championship
soccer trophy.

151
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,300
I can't believe he kept this.

152
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,500
It was the probably the closest
you ever came to being a boy.

153
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,200
Oh, wow!

154
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,900
It's my first sawed-off.
I made it myself.

155
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,000
Sixth grade.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,700
Holy crap.

157
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,100
Look at this.
He had land mines...

158
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,800
Which they didn't take.

159
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,000
Or the guns.

160
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,400
Guess they knew what they were after ?

161
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
Hey, Dean, check this out.

162
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
See these symbols?

163
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,100
He used binding magic.

164
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,700
These are curse boxes.

165
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,999
Curse boxes?

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,699
They're supposed to keep
the evil mojo in, right?

167
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,699
Kind of like the pandora deal.

168
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Yeah, they're built to contain
the power of the cursed object.

169
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,599
Dad's journal did mention
a whole bunch of stuff,

170
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,099
You know, dangerous,
hexed items, fetishes.

171
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,499
He never did say
where they ended up.

172
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,199
Yeah.

173
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
This must be his toxic-waste dump.

174
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,000
One box is missing.

175
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,900
Great.

176
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,299
Well, maybe they didn't open it.

177
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,499
Come on, man.
Let's open it.

178
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,999
Shut up about the damn box!

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,499
Do you see what's happening here?

180
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,200
I'm literally bleeding to death.

181
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
- I'm gonna open it.
- Grossman...

182
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,300
Look, what if this
is really worth something?

183
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,800
What, we should
just hand it over to her?

184
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,700
We took all the risk.

185
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Hell, Wayne,

186
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,200
you got shot,

187
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,600
and all for a lousy few hundred bucks.

188
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,600
Now, we could make more selling
whatever it is ourselves.

189
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,700
Huh?

190
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,399
Are you kidding me?

191
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,700
Are you kidding me?!

192
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,199
It's a rabbit's foot.

193
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,300
It's a rabbit's foot, Grossman!

194
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I'm gonna die for a damn rabbit's foot.

195
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
Oh.

196
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Hey, Foster.

197
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,599
Hey, listen, guys,
not to be a drag or nothing,

198
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,799
but it's 6:00 in the morning.

199
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,699
- Right.
- Can't you guys keep it down?

200
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,300
No, we just got a situation here is all.
Sorry.

201
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,000
What the hell happened to you?

202
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,600
A shotgun happened to me.

203
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,999
- Hey, Grossman,
- Yeah?

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,800
Under my sink, there's a medical kit.

205
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,500
And get some water boiling.

206
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,000
I used to be an army medic,
you know, in nam.

207
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,700
So, I guess this is your lucky day.

208
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,100
Connecticut.

209
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,900
Last three digits 8-8-0.

210
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,900
Yep. That's it.

211
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,599
Should have blacked out their plates

212
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
Before they parked in front of
the security camera.

213
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Four kings.

214
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
You see that?

215
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

216
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Deal it up again.

217
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,199
Royal flush.

218
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,500
Grossman, that's the second
royal flush in eight hands.

219
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,300
I can't lose.

220
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,100
I mean, really,
I... I can't lose.

221
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
I think this thing really works.

222
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,800
You know what I'm saying?

223
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,300
I'll tell you one thing...
there's no way in hell

224
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
we are handing it over
to that stuck-up bitch.

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,899
- Freeze! - Freeze!

226
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,699
Nobody move!

227
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,099
- Don't move.
- Don't move!

228
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,400
- What is it?
- Stop!

229
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,799
All right. Give us the box.

230
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,399
Please tell me that you didn't...

231
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Oh, they did.

232
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
You opened it?!

233
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,599
Are you guys cops?

234
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,699
- Huh?
- Are you guys cops?!

235
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,000
What was in the box?

236
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,400
Oh, was that it, huh?
It was, wasn't it?

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What is that thing?

238
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,000
Sorry.

239
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,800
Dean...

240
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,400
I got it.

241
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
No, you don't.

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,800
Damn!

243
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,300
Whoa!

244
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,900
Sam!

245
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
That's a lucky break.

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,100
Is that a rabbit's foot?

247
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,000
I think it is.

248
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,400
Huh.

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,100
I'm not finding anything on it
in dad's journal.

250
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,499
- Dean, come on.
- What?

251
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,599
Hey, that was my gun
he was aiming at your head.

252
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,999
and my gun don't jam,
so that was a lucky break.

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Not to mention them taking themselves 
out... also a lucky break.

254
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,100
Here. Scratch one.

255
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Come on, Sam.

256
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,400
Scratch and win.

257
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Look, Dean, it's got to be
cursed somehow.

258
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,900
Otherwise, dad wouldn't 
have locked it up.

259
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,500
$1,200.

260
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,600
You just won $1,200.

261
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
Whoo!

262
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
I don't know, man.
It doesn't seem that cursed to me.

263
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,300
Grossman?

264
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,800
Grossman, get up.

265
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,600
Hey...

266
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,300
Grossman, get up.

267
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,200
Hey.

268
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Hey...

269
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,300
Grossman?

270
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,200
Oh.

271
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,000
Ahhh!

272
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,600
Oh, man.

273
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,299
Now, look, Bobby, we didn't know.

274
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,299
You touched it? Damn it, Sam.

275
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,000
Well, dad never told us
about this thing.

276
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,599
I mean, you knew about
a storage place in Black Rock?

277
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,099
His lockup? Yeah, I knew.

278
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,200
Hell, I built those curse boxes for him.

279
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,699
Listen, you have got a serious problem.

280
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,300
That rabbit's foot ain't 
no dime-store notion.

281
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,200
It's real hoodoo... old-world stuff.

282
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,700
Made by a Baton Rouge conjure
woman about 100 years ago.

283
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,300
It's a hell of a luck charm.

284
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,199
It's not a luck charm.
It's a curse.

285
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,100
She made it to kill people, Sam.

286
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,100
See,

287
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,500
you touch it, you own it.

288
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,400
You own it, sure, you get a run
of good luck to beat the devil.

289
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,299
But...

290
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,800
you lose it, that luck turns.

291
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,799
It turns so bad that 
you're dead inside a week.

292
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,199
So, I won't lose it, Bobby.

293
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,699
Everybody loses it!

294
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,500
Well, then, how do we break the curse?

295
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't know if you can.

296
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,200
Let me look through my library
and make some calls.

297
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,200
Just sit tight.

298
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Dude,

299
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
we're up 15 grand.

300
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,499
Don't worry.

301
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,099
Bobby will find a way to break it.

302
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,900
Till then, I say we hit Vegas,
pull a little "Rain Man."

303
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,899
You can be Rain Man.

304
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,300
We just lay low until 
Bobby calls back, okay?

305
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,099
Hi. Uh, table for two, please.

306
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,500
Congratulations!

307
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,699
Say that again?

308
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,100
You are the one millionth guest
of the Biggerson's restaurant family.

309
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,200
Right. If you hear anything,
give me a call.

310
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,700
Well, that clears my book.

311
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,200
The word's out.

312
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,800
Now we wait.

313
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,300
Now we eat.

314
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Good idea.

315
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,899
What do you like?
I got canned everything.

316
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,600
No, no, man.
Not eating in the r.v.

317
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,200
Look, I know a good place.

318
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,600
Wide menu, good service,
homey atmosphere...

319
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Garlic knots.

320
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
The menu's on their website.

321
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,700
Bobby's right.

322
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,700
This lore goes way back.

323
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Pure hoodoo.

324
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
You can't just cut one off any rabbit.

325
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,800
It has to be in a cemetery

326
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,600
under a full moon on a friday the 13th.

327
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,900
I think from now on,

328
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,300
we only go to places with Biggerson's.

329
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,800
Can I freshen you up?

330
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,400
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

331
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,800
Thanks.

332
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
- Oh.
- Oh.

333
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,200
Oh, I... No, don't worry.
That's okay. That's... I got it.

334
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,600
It's no trouble, really.

335
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,800
Okay.

336
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Sorry about that.

337
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
It's all right.

338
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,800
Dude,

339
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,900
if you were ever gonna get lucky...

340
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,700
Chill out.

341
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,100
Oh! Oh, jeez!

342
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Sorry.

343
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,500
How was that good?

344
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,000
Son of a bitch.

345
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,700
Come on.

346
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,900
Whoa!

347
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Wow.

348
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
You suck.

349
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,900
So, what, now your luck turns bad?

350
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,300
I guess.

351
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,600
I wonder how bad.

352
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,299
Looks good.

353
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,600
I like that when they drop
the whole onion in the fryer.

354
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,400
Nearest location...

355
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,700
You seeing that?

356
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,400
Yes, I am.

357
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,300
<i>Adios compadre.</i>

358
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,300
Oh, man.

359
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,200
What do you want?

360
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,500
Heard about your friend.

361
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
It's bad luck.

362
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,700
Piss off.

363
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,000
We know someone hired you
to steal the rabbit's foot...

364
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,800
A woman.

365
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,900
Yeah?

366
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,900
How do you know that?

367
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
Because she just stole it back from us.

368
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,500
Listen, man, this is...

369
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
Sam, you okay?

370
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,300
Yeah. I'm good.

371
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,700
I want you to tell us her name.

372
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,900
Screw you.

373
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,800
It wasn't a freak accident
that killed your partner.

374
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,300
What?

375
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,800
It was the rabbit's foot.

376
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,300
You're crazy, man.

377
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
You know I'm not.

378
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,599
You saw what happened, what it did...

379
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,400
All the flukes, all the luck.

380
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,100
When you lose the foot,
that luck goes sour.

381
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
That's what killed your friend.

382
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,600
And my brother here is next,

383
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,300
and who knows how many more
innocent people after that.

384
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,499
Now, if you don't help us
stop this thing,

385
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,400
then that puts those deaths 
on your head.

386
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,900
Now, I can read people...

387
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,800
and I get it.

388
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,099
You're a thief and a scumbag.

389
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,000
That's fine.

390
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,800
But you're not a killer...

391
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,500
Are you?

392
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,200
No one saw which way they went,

393
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,600
and their meal was free,
so there's no credit-card trail.

394
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,999
Don't worry. We'll find them.

395
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,500
What makes you so sure?

396
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,500
'cause there's a higher power 
at work here.

397
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,300
I know it now.

398
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,106
Hello.

399
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,500
Dean, great news.

400
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,899
Wasn't easy, but I found a heavyweight
cleansing ritual that should do the trick.

401
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Bobby, that's, uh, great,
except Sam, uh...

402
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,199
...Sam lost the foot.

403
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,300
He what?

404
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,199
Bobby, listen, listen.

405
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,399
This hot chick stole it from him.

406
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,600
I'm serious.

407
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,899
In her mid-20s, and she was sharp, 
you know?

408
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,600
Good enough of a con to play us.

409
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,899
And she only gave the guys 
she hired a name...

410
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,399
Probably an alias or something.

411
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,900
Luigi or something.

412
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,299
Lugosi.

413
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Lugosi?

414
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Lugosi.

415
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,500
Oh, crap. It's probably Bela.

416
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,999
Bela Lugosi? That's cute.

417
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,800
Bela Talbot's her real name.

418
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,900
Crossed paths with her once or twice.

419
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,699
She knew about the rabbit's foot.
Is she a hunter?

420
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,499
Pretty friggin' far from a hunter,

421
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,400
but she knows her way
around the territory.

422
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,699
She's been out of the country.

423
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,000
Last I heard, she was
in the middle east someplace.

424
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,500
I guess she's back.

425
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,300
Which means seriously bad luck for you.

426
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,400
Great.

427
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,500
But if it is Bela,

428
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,600
at least I might know some folks
who know where to find her.

429
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,200
Thanks, Bobby, again.

430
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,700
Just look out for your brother,
you idjit.

431
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,800
What?

432
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,600
I lost my shoe.

433
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,300
All right, Bobby, thanks.
Hey, we owe you...another one.

434
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,899
All right, Bobby's got it
on pretty good authority

435
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,500
that this Bela chick lives in Queens.

436
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
So it will take me about two hours
to get there.

437
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,300
So, what are we doing then?

438
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,199
You, my brother, are staying here,

439
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
'cause I don't want
your bad luck getting us killed.

440
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,299
What am I even supposed to do, Dean?

441
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,900
Nothing. Nothing. Come here.

442
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,099
I don't want you doing anything.

443
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,500
I want you to sit right here

444
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,500
and don't move, okay?

445
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,800
Don't turn on the light.
Don't turn off the light.

446
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,600
Don't even scratch your nose.

447
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,400
Because you shook on 1.5.

448
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Well, maybe I should just take it 
somewhere else.

449
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,400
Don't threaten me, Luke.

450
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,400
Despite your reputation,
you don't scare me.

451
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,200
Well, I'm glad you see it that way.

452
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,300
I'll see you at the airstrip in an hour.

453
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,100
???

454
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
Oh, come on. I...

455
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,400
I didn't...

456
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,500
Ah!

457
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,600
You're gonna give it back.

458
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,100
Sweetie,

459
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
no, I'm not.

460
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Yeah? We'll see.

461
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,900
Bela, right?

462
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,200
That's right...

463
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,800
Dean.

464
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,400
You know the thing's cursed,
don't you?

465
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,599
You'd be surprised what some people
would pay for something like that.

466
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,300
Really?

467
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,900
There's a lucrative market out there.

468
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,000
A lot of money to be made.

469
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,299
You hunters, with all those amulets
and talismans you use

470
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,900
to stop those big, bad monsters...

471
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,099
Any one of them could put your 
children's children through college.

472
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,500
So, you know the truth

473
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,899
about what's really going on out there,

474
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
and this is what you decide 
to do with it?

475
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,300
You become a thief.

476
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,300
I procure unique items
for a select clientele.

477
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,300
Yeah.

478
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,399
A thief.

479
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,700
No.

480
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,400
A great thief.

481
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,200
Oh, he's awake.

482
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,100
Back with us, eh?

483
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,899
We didn't even have to touch you.

484
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,900
???
and knocked yourself out.

485
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,000
It was like watching Jerry Lewis
trying to stack chairs.

486
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,500
Who are you?

487
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,200
What do you want...

488
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,800
I used to think your friend Gordon 
sent me...

489
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,299
Gordon?

490
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,199
Oh, come on.

491
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,400
...because he asked me to track you down

492
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,800
and put a bullet in your brain.

493
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,100
Great. That sounds like him.

494
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,800
But

495
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
as it turns out...

496
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,900
I'm on a mission from God.

497
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,500
Look, Bela.

498
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,800
My brother, he... touched the foot.

499
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,799
And when you took it from him,
his luck went from...

500
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,400
I know how it works.

501
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,000
So, then you know he's gonna die
unless we can destroy it.

502
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Oh.

503
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,600
You can have the foot...

504
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,100
For $1.5 million.

505
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,000
Nice.

506
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,900
Yeah. I'll just call my banker.

507
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,300
How'd you even find the damn thing,

508
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,399
stuck in the back of some storage place,

509
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
middle of nowhere?

510
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I just asked a few of the ghosts
of the people it had killed.

511
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,900
They were very tuned in to its location.

512
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,599
So you're only after yourself, huh?

513
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,900
It's all about number one.

514
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,500
Being a hunter is so much more noble?

515
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,099
A bunch of obsessed, 
revenge-driven sociopaths

516
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
trying to save a world 
that can't be saved.

517
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,800
Well, aren't you
a glass half full.

518
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,000
We're all going to hell, Dean.

519
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,299
Might as well enjoy the ride.

520
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,900
I actually agree with you there.

521
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,400
Anyhoo, this has been charming,
but, uh, look at the time.

522
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,600
Oh, and...

523
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,600
This.

524
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,099
You're not the only one
with sticky fingers.

525
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,500
If it's any consolation, I think
you're a truly awful person.

526
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,199
You were a part of that demon plan
to open the gate, weren't you?

527
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,499
We did everything we could to stop it.

528
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,000
Lie, lie, lie!

529
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,100
You were in on it.

530
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,199
You know what they're next move
is, too, don't you?

531
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,000
No, I don't, okay?
You're wrong about all of this.

532
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,800
Where are they gonna hit us next?

533
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,800
Where?!

534
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,800
Gordon told me about you, Sam,

535
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
about your powers.

536
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,399
You're some kind of
weirdo psychic freak.

537
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,399
No, not anymore.

538
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,399
I have no powers, no visions... nothing.

539
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,900
- It just...
- Lie!

540
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,900
Now no more lies.

541
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,099
There's an army of demons out there,

542
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,400
pushing at a world already on the brink.

543
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,000
we're on deck 
for the end game here, right?

544
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,600
So maybe,

545
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,000
just maybe you can understand

546
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,299
why we can't take chances.

547
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,399
Whoa! Okay, okay.

548
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,999
- Now, hold on a minute.
- Kubrick, get...

549
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,200
No! You saw what happened, Creedie.

550
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,600
Ask yourself...

551
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,500
Why are we here?

552
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,100
Because you saw a picture on the web?

553
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Because we chose this motel
instead of another?

554
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,999
Luck like that doesn't just happen.

555
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,199
Look, I can explain all of that.

556
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Shut up.

557
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,300
It's God, Creedie.

558
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,300
He led us here for one reason...

559
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,100
To do his work.

560
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,700
This is destiny.

561
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,600
Whoa.

562
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,800
No.

563
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
No destiny.

564
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,900
Just a rabbit's foot.

565
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,099
Put the gun down, son,

566
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,300
or you're gonna be
scraping brain off the wall.

567
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,700
Oh, this thing?

568
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah, that thing.

569
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,200
Okay.

570
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,300
But, you see, there's something
about me that you don't know.

571
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,700
Yeah? What would that be?

572
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
It's my lucky day.

573
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,200
Oh, my God!
Did you see that shot?!

574
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,900
I'm amazing.

575
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,900
I'm Batman.

576
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Yeah.

577
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,800
You're Batman.

578
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,700
All right.

579
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,200
Bone ash,

580
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,800
cayenne pepper.

581
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,000
That should do it.

582
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
One second.

583
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:52,899
Dean...

584
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,400
Hey, back off, jinx.

585
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,100
I'm bringing home the bacon.

586
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
All right.

587
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,900
Say goodbye to "Wascawy Wabbit."

588
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,400
I think you'll find that belongs to me.

589
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,200
Or, you know...

590
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,000
Whatever.

591
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,900
Put the foot down, honey.

592
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,700
No.

593
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,700
You're not gonna shoot anybody.

594
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,400
See, I happen to be able to read people.

595
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Okay, you're a thief. fine.
But you're not...

596
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,600
Oh!

597
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:35,999
Son of a...

598
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,900
Back off, tiger.

599
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,800
Back off.

600
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
You make one more move,
and I'll pull the trigger.

601
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,800
You've got the luck, Dean.
You I can't hit.

602
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
But your brother...

603
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,800
Him I can't miss.

604
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,800
What the hell is wrong with you?!

605
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,099
You don't just do around
shooting people like that!

606
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
Relax.

607
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,100
It's a shoulder hit. I can aim.

608
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,200
Besides,

609
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
who here hasn't shot a few people?

610
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,999
Put the rabbit's foot on the ground now.

611
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,900
All right!

612
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,000
All right.

613
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
Take it easy.

614
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,500
Think fast.

615
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,500
Damn.

616
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,600
Now,

617
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,100
what do you say we destroy
that ugly-ass piece of dead thing?

618
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,100
Thanks very much.

619
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,299
I'm out $1.5 million

620
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,700
and on the bad side of a very powerful,
fairly psychotic buyer.

621
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Wow.

622
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,899
I really don't feel bad about that.

623
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,800
Sam?

624
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,700
No.

625
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,500
Not even a little.

626
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,100
Maybe next time,

627
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,400
I'll hang you out to dry.

628
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,500
Oh, don't go away angry. Just go away.

629
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,500
Have a nice night, boys.

630
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,800
You good?

631
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
I'll live.

632
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,800
I guess we're back to normal now, huh?

633
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,599
No good luck.

634
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,900
No bad luck.

635
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,700
Oh,

636
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,199
I forgot. We're at $46,000.

637
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
I almost forgot about the...

638
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,500
scratch tickets.

639
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,400
Son of a bitch!

640
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,400
You were right about everything.

641
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,900
Sam Winchester is more than a monster.

642
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,500
He's the adversary.

643
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,700
And what was it that convinced you?

644
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
God led me to him...

645
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
And his will is clear.

646
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,300
Okay.

647
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,900
That's great.

648
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
I'm glad to have you on board.

649
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
But, uh, first things first.

650
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,600
We got to get me the hell out of here.

651
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,200
'cause like i told you before,

652
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,199
Sam Winchester must die.
