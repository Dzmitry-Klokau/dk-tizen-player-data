00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:29.558
And the second you find out this ruby chick
is a demon, you go for the holy water.

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:31.671
- You don't chat.
- No one was chatting, dean.

00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:34.922
- Then why didn't you send her ass back to hell?
- She told me she could help you, okay?

00:00:34.923 --> 00:00:36.661
She knows what your weakness is.It's me.

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:40.330
- Think something's wrong with my brother?
- No. Demons lie.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.662
Last i checked, dean's
still going to hell.

00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:44.560
Everything in its own time, sam.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.279
You're gonna have to do things that
go against that gentle nature of yours.

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:51.080
- On the bright side,
- i'll be there with you...

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:55.503
That little fallen
angel on your shoulder.

00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:18.433
That was just a terrible, terrible party.

00:01:19.492 --> 00:01:22.299
But there was this one
really beautiful woman there.

00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:26.793
- You should have gone home with her.
- I did.

00:01:33.252 --> 00:01:35.562
- I need a few minutes.
- All right.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.398
There's a bottle of '89 in the fridge.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.173
Oh, god.

00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:37.760
What the...

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.788
Paul!

00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:47.040
- What is it?
- It's my teeth.

00:02:49.414 --> 00:02:51.840
- Janet?!
- Help me!

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.200
Supernatural season 3 episode 9

00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:27.200
Transcript : www.Yyets.net
Synchro : Flolo

00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:36.623
I couldn't help. I couldn't
do anything to stop it.

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.920
I've talked to the police and i've
talked to the medical examiner

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.668
And no one can explain it.

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.060
That's why they put the
call into us, mr. Dutton.

00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:48.705
But the cdc... That's
disease control, right?

00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:50.732
What do you think
it's some kind of virus?

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:52.830
We're not ruling out anything yet.

00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:55.960
- Mr. Dutton, did janet have any enemies?
- I'm sorry?

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.386
Anyone that had a reason to hurt her?

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.827
What are you saying that
somebody poisoned her?

00:04:02.348 --> 00:04:04.673
I'm just saying we have to cover
every base here.

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.229
I mean, what kind of poison? You think
a person could have done this?

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.429
- Would anyone want to?
- What? No.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.400
No, there's no one that could have...

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.113
Mr. Dutton?

00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:22.043
Uh, everyone loved janet.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:30.577
Okay.Thank you very much.
I think we got everything we need.

00:04:30.578 --> 00:04:32.067
We'll be out of your way now.

00:04:37.282 --> 00:04:39.930
- That dude seem a little evasive to you?
- I don't know.

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.776
I was under a sink...pulling this out.

00:04:43.057 --> 00:04:44.460
Hex bag.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.753
- Ohh, gross.
- Yeah.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.838
Bird bones, rabbit's teeth.
This cloth was probably cut

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.230
from something janet dutton owned.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.089
- So we're thinking witch?
- Uh, yeah.

00:04:55.136 --> 00:04:57.949
And not some new-Age wiccan
water douser, either.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.130
This is old-World black magic, dean,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.162
I mean, warts and all.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.539
I hate witches.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.742
They're always spewing
their bodily fluids everywhere.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.263
- Pretty much.
- It's creepy. It's downright unsanitary.

00:05:15.264 --> 00:05:18.422
Yeah, well, someone definitely
had it out for janet dutton.

00:05:18.432 --> 00:05:20.730
Yeah, someone who snuck into
that house and planted the bag.

00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:24.275
So, what are we thinking? Looking for
some craggy old blair bitch in the woods?

00:05:24.276 --> 00:05:27.837
No, it could be anyone...
A neighbor, coworker, man, woman.

00:05:27.838 --> 00:05:29.492
They're human. They're like everyone else.

00:05:29.493 --> 00:05:31.930
- How are we gonna find them?
- This wasn't random.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.730
Someone in janet dutton's life
had an ugly ax to grind.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.265
- We find the motive...
- We find the murderer.

00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:38.384
Yeah.

00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:57.881
Amanda?

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.869
- Hey, amanda!
- Oh, elizabeth, hi.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.400
Sorry, i've got, like,
a thousand things on my mind.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.187
Are you okay, sweetie?

00:06:08.273 --> 00:06:10.140
You didn't come to book club last night.

00:06:10.141 --> 00:06:13.443
Yeah, sorry.I was gonna call.
I just... I got busy, you know?

00:06:14.726 --> 00:06:18.228
But i'm fine, really. I am. Thanks.

00:07:41.404 --> 00:07:44.653
This dinner was cooked for you,
paul arthur dutton.

00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:49.204
Now you're going to eat it.

00:08:45.187 --> 00:08:46.567
Got it!

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.000
You okay?

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.834
What the hell is happening to me?

00:09:07.852 --> 00:09:09.760
Someone murdered your wife.
Now they're trying to kill you.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.759
That's impossible. There's no way...

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.130
If we hadn't been following you,
you'd be a doornail.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.595
Now, who wants you dead?

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:19.129
- Come on, think.
- There's a woman.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.127
- Okay, a woman.
- An affair, a-A mistake.

00:09:22.301 --> 00:09:26.043
She was unbalanced. She was blackmailing me.
I put an end to it a week ago.

00:09:26.053 --> 00:09:27.660
- What's her name?
- Wha...

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.929
- What could she have to do with what...
- Paul, what is her name?

00:10:34.241 --> 00:10:37.154
- That's a curveball.
- Yeah.

00:10:53.145 --> 00:10:55.633
Three per wrist vertical.

00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:57.586
She wasn't fooling around.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.844
Yeah, looks like she was working
some heavy weight evil here.

00:11:10.845 --> 00:11:11.768
Yep.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.641
Freaking witches! Seriously, man! Come on!

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.915
Guess we know where she got
the rabbit's teeth from.

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:27.383
Paul knows how to pick 'em.
It's like "fatal attraction" all over again.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.560
Why's the rabbit always
get screwed in the deal?

00:11:31.436 --> 00:11:33.135
Poor little guy.

00:11:33.642 --> 00:11:37.894
You know what i don't get, dean? If
she was so bent on revenge, why do this?

00:11:38.005 --> 00:11:41.260
Well, she got janet dutton,

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.160
Thought she finished off paul,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.078
decided to cap herself and make it
a spurned lover's hat trick.

00:11:46.106 --> 00:11:47.646
Maybe.

00:11:48.264 --> 00:11:52.479
This doesn't exactly look like a tv room
of a bright and stable person, you know?

00:11:52.498 --> 00:11:53.925
No.

00:11:54.132 --> 00:11:55.830
But then...

00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:02.200
... there's this.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.775
Another hex bag? Come on.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.397
Looks like we got a hit, huh?
A little witch-On-Witch violence.

00:12:15.398 --> 00:12:16.937
I guess.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.109
I'd like to report a dead body
at 309 mayfair circle.

00:12:21.156 --> 00:12:23.898
My name? Yeah, sure, my name is...

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.724
Why are witches ganking each other?

00:12:29.056 --> 00:12:33.197
I don't know, but i think maybe
we got a coven on our hands.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.406
All right, all right. I'm going.

00:12:45.838 --> 00:12:48.683
I'm not fooled by your
little book club, by the way.

00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:50.908
I know what you ladies get up
to when i'm gone.

00:12:50.909 --> 00:12:53.130
It's all dish and gossip.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.129
Hi, ron.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.166
Oh, hello, elizabeth.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.300
I mean, when's the last time
anyone actually brought a book?

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.200
- Good night, ron.
- Good night, ron.

00:13:03.672 --> 00:13:04.987
All right.

00:13:08.845 --> 00:13:12.375
He doesn't know?
You didn't tell him?

00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:13.962
About amanda?

00:13:14.406 --> 00:13:17.467
I think that's book
club business, don't you?

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.843
Thank you, tammi.

00:13:19.844 --> 00:13:23.528
The police just took away her body, and
we're just gonna pretend it didn't happen?

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.359
He loved amanda.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.793
It's true.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:31.017
We know that she was a little... unstable.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.979
- Also true.
- And we have to face it...

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.674
She probably killed janet dutton.

00:13:36.675 --> 00:13:39.660
People just don't spit out
their teeth all of a sudden.

00:13:40.198 --> 00:13:41.832
We have to stop.

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:46.020
We have to stop book club.
This has all gone too far.

00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:49.034
Elizabeth, just take a deep breath.

00:13:49.089 --> 00:13:50.920
Calm down.

00:13:50.921 --> 00:13:52.770
We can't stop.

00:13:52.771 --> 00:13:54.836
But people are dying.

00:13:55.164 --> 00:13:59.978
Amanda killed herself, yes.
And, yes, she killed janet.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.485
Awful, awful business, of course,

00:14:03.645 --> 00:14:06.142
But that's all over now.

00:14:06.917 --> 00:14:10.907
And think about what
book club has gotten us, hmm?

00:14:11.136 --> 00:14:13.211
Your husband's promotion,

00:14:13.492 --> 00:14:16.469
That little trip to hawaii that you won.

00:14:17.096 --> 00:14:19.012
And what about me?

00:14:19.013 --> 00:14:22.120
My home pottery business
is finally taking off,

00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:24.522
and you want to just stop?

00:14:25.473 --> 00:14:28.000
Do you want to stop?

00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:32.922
Okay. Now, come on.
We don't have much time.

00:14:32.923 --> 00:14:36.115
Ron gets back from his
fantasy football in an hour.

00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:48.054
Book of shadows, we kneel before you.

00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:51.293
Let us serve your master as you serve us.

00:14:51.486 --> 00:14:54.735
Book of shadows, we kneel before you.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.200
Let us serve your master...

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.845
You must have a green thumb.

00:15:05.846 --> 00:15:07.141
Excuse me?

00:15:07.142 --> 00:15:09.629
Getting these herbs to grow out
of season like this.

00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:12.175
Quite impressive.

00:15:12.255 --> 00:15:14.847
I'm sorry. I should have
introduced myself first.

00:15:14.848 --> 00:15:18.300
I'm, uh, detective bachman,
and this is detective turner.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.600
Hiya.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.612
We're following up
on amanda burns' death.

00:15:21.613 --> 00:15:24.344
Going around the neighborhood,
talking to her neighbors.

00:15:24.345 --> 00:15:27.276
But didn't she... I mean,
she killed herself, right?

00:15:27.277 --> 00:15:30.630
- Maybe, maybe.
- We heard you were friends with the deceased, right?

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.330
Yeah, i guess so.

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:35.200
Do you have any idea about her practices?

00:15:35.405 --> 00:15:37.830
I'm sorry? What... What kind of practices?

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.500
Well, her house was littered
with satanic paraphernalia.

00:15:40.501 --> 00:15:45.090
- It was a regular black sabbath.
- No, th... But she was an episcopalian.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.640
Well, then we're pretty sure
she was using the wrong bible.

00:15:51.467 --> 00:15:52.900
Elizabeth.

00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:55.767
Are you all right?

00:15:55.768 --> 00:15:58.530
I'm fine.Uh, renee, these are detectives.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.659
- They say amanda was... She was practicing...
- Sorry, detectives.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.307
You can tell that elizabeth is a little upset.

00:16:06.747 --> 00:16:08.456
Of course, miss...

00:16:08.465 --> 00:16:13.039
Mrs.Renee van allen.

00:16:14.054 --> 00:16:16.232
Would you like me to spell it for you?

00:16:16.233 --> 00:16:18.185
I'll get by, thanks.

00:16:18.496 --> 00:16:21.764
This amanda business has been hard for liz,

00:16:21.985 --> 00:16:23.478
For all of us.

00:16:23.544 --> 00:16:26.760
Yeah, i mean, you think you know a person.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.660
Well, i guess we all have secrets, don't we?

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.516
Well, thanks. Um, we'll be in touch.

00:16:37.628 --> 00:16:39.365
Have a nice day.

00:16:39.469 --> 00:16:40.731
Bye.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.768
Well, i'm already sold on
that elizabeth chick.

00:16:58.769 --> 00:17:01.013
Did you see that victory garden of hers?

00:17:01.014 --> 00:17:03.737
Belladonna, wolfsbane, mandrake.

00:17:03.863 --> 00:17:06.887
Not to mention that little flinch she threw
when we mentioned the occult.

00:17:06.888 --> 00:17:09.260
Well, she's definitely had
a good run lately.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:14.030
Gone up a few tax brackets,
won almost too many raffles...

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.518
The kind of thing a little black
magic always helps with.

00:17:16.546 --> 00:17:17.767
Yeah.

00:17:17.788 --> 00:17:22.975
I don't think she's alone, either.
It looks like mrs.Renee van allen

00:17:22.976 --> 00:17:26.446
has won almost every craft contest
she's entered in the past three months.

00:17:26.447 --> 00:17:29.811
A regular martha stewart, huh?
Except for the devil worship.

00:17:29.823 --> 00:17:33.205
I'm thinking that was the coven
we met back there, minus one member.

00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:35.713
Amanda was clearly going off
the reservation.

00:17:35.714 --> 00:17:38.130
You think they killed her
to keep up appearances?

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.100
Seems like an appearance kind
of crowd, don't you think?

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:40.936
Yeah.

00:17:40.937 --> 00:17:44.400
If they killed a nut job,
should we thank them or what?

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.274
They work in black magic, too, dean.
They need to be stopped.

00:17:48.612 --> 00:17:50.530
Stopped, like stopped?

00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:54.489
- They're human, sam.
- They're murderers.

00:17:58.431 --> 00:18:00.230
Burn, witch, burn.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.526
Ruby.

00:18:17.527 --> 00:18:19.281
Sam, listen to me. There's no time.

00:18:19.282 --> 00:18:22.160
- What are you talking about?
- You have to get out of town.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.973
So, this is ruby, huh?

00:18:24.161 --> 00:18:27.249
- Never had the pleasure.
- Dean. I was hoping you'd show up again.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.430
Point that thing somewhere else.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.811
Right.

00:18:30.812 --> 00:18:32.652
Sam, please. Go.

00:18:32.755 --> 00:18:35.330
Get in the car and don't look back.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.223
- Why? I don't understand.
- Hey, hot stuff, we can take care of

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.422
- a few kitchen witches, thanks.
- I'm not talking about witches, you jackass.

00:18:41.423 --> 00:18:43.309
Witches are whores.

00:18:43.319 --> 00:18:46.070
I'm talking about who they serve.

00:18:49.019 --> 00:18:50.330
Demons.

00:18:52.065 --> 00:18:54.400
- They get their power from demons.
- Yeah.

00:18:55.121 --> 00:18:58.806
- And there's one here now.
- Oh, what, you mean besides you?

00:18:58.807 --> 00:19:01.126
Sam, it knows you're in town,
and it's gonna come after you,

00:19:01.127 --> 00:19:04.958
- and it's way more than you can handle.
- Oh, come on. What is this, huh?

00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:06.885
Please tell me you're not
listening to this crap.

00:19:06.886 --> 00:19:09.308
Put a leash on your brother, sam,
if you want to keep him.

00:19:09.326 --> 00:19:11.407
- Dean, just chill out.
- No! No!

00:19:11.408 --> 00:19:14.547
She's messing with your head!
God knows why. That's who they are!

00:19:14.548 --> 00:19:17.063
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I'm telling you to shut up, bitch!

00:19:17.064 --> 00:19:19.589
I'm sorry. Why are you even
a part of this conversation?

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.465
Maybe because he's my brother,
you black-Eyed skank!

00:19:22.466 --> 00:19:24.963
Oh, right, right. And you care
about your brother so much.

00:19:24.964 --> 00:19:27.394
That's why you're checking out,
leaving him all alone.

00:19:27.395 --> 00:19:29.179
- Shut up.
- Let me try and save him

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.766
since you won't be here
to do it anymore.

00:19:30.767 --> 00:19:33.000
- I said shut up!
- Dean, no!

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.876
What the hell were you thinking?

00:19:51.877 --> 00:19:54.026
What? What the hell was i thinking?

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:57.895
She's a demon, sam, period. All right?
They want us dead. We want them dead.

00:19:57.896 --> 00:20:00.369
Oh, that's funny. I remember
that demon chick in ohio...

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.610
- Casey... You didn't want her dead.
- Well, she wasn't stringing

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.636
me along like a fish on a hook.

00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:07.010
No one's stringing me along!

00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:12.210
Look, i know it's dangerous
that she is dangerous

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.692
- but like it or not, she's useful.
- No! We kill her before she kills us.

00:20:16.693 --> 00:20:20.329
Kill her with what?
The gun she fixed for us?

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.673
- Whatever works.
- Dean, if she wants us dead,

00:20:22.674 --> 00:20:25.180
all she has to do is
stop saving our lives.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.433
Look, we have to start looking
at the big picture, dean.

00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:30.832
start thinking in strategies
and and moves ahead.

00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:34.317
It's not so simple. We're not
just hunting anymore.

00:20:34.336 --> 00:20:36.242
We're at war.

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:41.052
Are you feeling okay?

00:20:41.567 --> 00:20:43.483
Why are you always asking me that?

00:20:43.484 --> 00:20:46.418
Because you're taking advice
from a demon, for starters.

00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:49.265
And, by the way, you seem less
and less worried about offing people.

00:20:49.266 --> 00:20:52.317
- It used to eat you up inside.
- And what has that gotten me?

00:20:52.412 --> 00:20:54.966
Nothing, but it's just want
you're supposed to do, okay?

00:20:54.988 --> 00:20:58.226
We're supposed to drive in the freaking
car and freaking argue about this stuff!

00:20:58.227 --> 00:21:00.911
You go on about the sanctity
of life and all that crap.

00:21:00.942 --> 00:21:04.680
Wait, so you're mad because i'm
starting to agree with you?

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.015
No, i'm not mad! I'm... I'm...

00:21:08.797 --> 00:21:10.234
I'm worried.

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:12.850
Sam, i'm worried because you're
not acting like yourself.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.556
Yeah, you're right.I'm not.

00:21:14.557 --> 00:21:16.285
I don't have a choice.

00:21:16.286 --> 00:21:17.910
What is that supposed to mean?

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.280
Look, dean, you're leaving, right?

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:25.178
And i got to stay here in
this crap hole of a world...

00:21:25.413 --> 00:21:26.747
Alone.

00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:30.062
So, the way i see it,
if i'm gonna make it,

00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:33.575
if i'm gonna fight this war after you're
gone, then i got to change.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.380
Change into what?

00:21:35.926 --> 00:21:37.380
Into you.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.598
I got to be more like you.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.236
What's going on with you?

00:21:49.237 --> 00:21:50.588
I don't know.

00:21:53.241 --> 00:21:54.903
Sam, something's wrong.

00:21:54.904 --> 00:21:56.794
A bunch of knives inside of me.

00:21:56.795 --> 00:21:58.587
- Dean?
- Son of a bitch.

00:21:58.588 --> 00:21:59.686
Dean.

00:22:01.505 --> 00:22:04.191
The coven, man. It's got to be the coven.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.410
Dean, i can't find it!

00:22:33.706 --> 00:22:34.636
No.

00:22:40.891 --> 00:22:42.810
Sam, what are you doing?

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.050
Oh, my god!

00:23:08.807 --> 00:23:11.680
- Let him go.
- Let who go? What are you doing?

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.116
You're insane. Get out!

00:23:13.117 --> 00:23:15.567
Look, if you know about me,
then you know about this gun.

00:23:15.568 --> 00:23:17.971
You're killing my brother.
Now let him go.

00:23:17.972 --> 00:23:19.727
- Get away from the altar.
- What?

00:23:19.728 --> 00:23:21.007
Now!

00:23:29.798 --> 00:23:33.478
You want to kill me? Get in line, bitch.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.306
Stop... calling me bitch.

00:23:51.307 --> 00:23:52.311
Go.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.510
What? We weren't hurting anyone.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.010
Please, we don't even know your brother.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.380
Stop the spell or die.

00:24:04.249 --> 00:24:06.410
- Five seconds.
- What?!

00:24:07.867 --> 00:24:09.867
No, please. Please don't kill us.

00:24:09.868 --> 00:24:12.552
We were just getting renee
a lower mortgage rate.

00:24:15.449 --> 00:24:19.643
Next time you point that gun at me, I'm not
gonna just disappear, understand?

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.437
- You...saved my life.
- Don't mention it.

00:24:25.889 --> 00:24:27.617
What was that stuff?

00:24:28.661 --> 00:24:30.398
God, it was ass.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.389
It tasted like ass.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.925
It's called witchcraft, short bus.

00:24:39.153 --> 00:24:40.909
You're the short bus.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.340
"Short bus."

00:24:42.868 --> 00:24:45.939
Okay, maybe it's not you...

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.431
... or you.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.750
Maybe it's you.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.738
I don't even know what he's talking about.
What are you even talking about?

00:24:59.739 --> 00:25:01.888
I mean, all of you everyone
in your little coven.

00:25:01.889 --> 00:25:03.708
You've all had runs of good fortune...

00:25:03.709 --> 00:25:05.475
Newsworthy good fortune.

00:25:05.476 --> 00:25:07.110
Except for you, tammi.

00:25:08.313 --> 00:25:11.412
Now, tell me, why is that?
You didn't want anything for yourself,

00:25:11.413 --> 00:25:13.938
or is it because you're already
getting what you wanted,

00:25:13.939 --> 00:25:15.954
like these women's souls?

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.610
I can't... I'm not... I don't...

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.650
Nice dick work, magnum.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.974
Let... my brother... go.

00:25:36.022 --> 00:25:39.150
What's wrong? Couldn't find my hex bag?

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.572
Sorry, sweetheart, but your brother's
lungs should be on the floor by now.

00:25:54.129 --> 00:25:56.448
You're in a lot of trouble, sam.

00:26:07.325 --> 00:26:09.814
Tammi, what's wrong with your eyes?

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.626
Tammi, what are you doing?

00:26:12.627 --> 00:26:14.889
Renee, shut your painted hole.

00:26:15.351 --> 00:26:16.515
What?

00:26:16.977 --> 00:26:19.869
I-I will... You can't...

00:26:19.889 --> 00:26:22.255
Not in my house, tammi benton.

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.632
Look! You got me!

00:26:28.633 --> 00:26:31.527
- Let the girl go.
- Wait your turn, young man.

00:26:33.122 --> 00:26:34.943
Ohh, god!

00:26:36.364 --> 00:26:39.049
Lizzy, it's okay.

00:26:40.047 --> 00:26:41.868
You're not tammi?

00:26:41.926 --> 00:26:44.790
No. But i'm wearing her meat.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.934
I had to break the ice with you girls somehow.

00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:50.154
You killed renee.

00:26:50.321 --> 00:26:53.006
Renee, amanda.

00:26:53.535 --> 00:26:57.253
That's what happens to witches
who get voted off the island.

00:26:57.399 --> 00:26:59.149
Who are you?

00:26:59.517 --> 00:27:01.939
Funny story, actually.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:08.267
You remember all those dark, demonic forces
you prayed to when you swore your servitude?

00:27:08.677 --> 00:27:11.053
Just who did you think you were praying to?

00:27:11.054 --> 00:27:14.245
This... This isn't... It can't be.

00:27:14.246 --> 00:27:16.016
What did you think it was?

00:27:16.017 --> 00:27:19.167
Make-Believe, positive thinking,

00:27:19.168 --> 00:27:20.712
The secret?

00:27:20.713 --> 00:27:23.163
No. It was me.

00:27:23.209 --> 00:27:25.904
You sold yourself to me, you pig.

00:27:28.016 --> 00:27:31.021
All i had to do was bring
one good book to book club,

00:27:31.022 --> 00:27:33.631
and you ladies lined up to kiss my ass.

00:27:33.632 --> 00:27:36.645
No. No. We didn't know...

00:27:36.646 --> 00:27:41.407
Oh, yes, you did. You knew
every step of the way,

00:27:41.408 --> 00:27:44.450
and now your ever-Living souls are mine.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.056
Comments, questions?

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.102
Sammy winchester, wow.

00:27:54.234 --> 00:27:56.496
Right here in our little town.

00:27:56.933 --> 00:28:01.262
You know, my friends and
i we've been looking for you.

00:28:01.653 --> 00:28:02.977
Why?

00:28:02.978 --> 00:28:05.948
Oh, right, because i'm supposed
to lead some piss-Poor demon army.

00:28:05.966 --> 00:28:09.783
No, not at all. You're not our messiah.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.055
We don't believe in you.

00:28:12.252 --> 00:28:15.989
But there's a new leader rising in the west.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.448
A real leader.

00:28:18.449 --> 00:28:20.409
That's the horse to bet on, sam,

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.715
the one who's gonna tear this world apart.

00:28:24.537 --> 00:28:29.398
Thing is, this demon
it doesn't like you very much.

00:28:29.399 --> 00:28:31.658
It doesn't want the competition.

00:28:39.339 --> 00:28:42.503
Nothing personal. It's a p. R. Thing.

00:28:43.442 --> 00:28:45.799
So, bye-Bye.

00:29:05.727 --> 00:29:08.084
Two for one. Lovely.

00:29:09.671 --> 00:29:11.014
Wait.

00:29:16.023 --> 00:29:17.329
Please.

00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:21.152
I just... came to talk.

00:29:21.498 --> 00:29:23.639
You made it out of the gate.

00:29:23.991 --> 00:29:25.502
Impressive.

00:29:25.701 --> 00:29:27.560
It was a bitch of a fight, wasn't it?

00:29:27.561 --> 00:29:29.871
Doors out of hell only open for so long.

00:29:29.872 --> 00:29:31.850
What do you want, ruby?

00:29:32.384 --> 00:29:34.384
I've been lost without you.

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:37.033
Take me back.

00:29:38.012 --> 00:29:40.378
That's why i led the winchesters here.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.878
They're for you... as a gift.

00:29:48.504 --> 00:29:50.129
Really?

00:29:50.896 --> 00:29:52.921
Let me serve you again.

00:29:53.818 --> 00:29:55.808
I've wanted it.

00:29:56.162 --> 00:29:59.467
I've wanted you for so long.

00:30:01.646 --> 00:30:04.125
You were one of my best.

00:30:11.663 --> 00:30:14.827
But then again, you always
were a lying whore.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:59.849
You're really telling me you threw in
your chips with abbott and costello here?

00:31:09.437 --> 00:31:12.075
Come on. Get up.

00:31:14.321 --> 00:31:16.424
I said get up!

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.475
We've been here before, haven't we?

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.597
She didn't tell you?

00:31:34.366 --> 00:31:36.253
Pretty mortifying, i guess.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.975
She was one of mine.

00:31:38.976 --> 00:31:42.561
I turned her out a long, long time ago.

00:31:43.017 --> 00:31:45.768
Ruby here was a witch.

00:31:45.777 --> 00:31:47.937
Of course, that was when you were human.

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:56.447
Didn't want your friends to know

00:31:56.457 --> 00:32:00.072
that all those centuries back,
you sold yourself to me?

00:32:00.283 --> 00:32:02.734
Embarrassing, i guess.

00:32:03.357 --> 00:32:04.896
But don't worry, love.

00:32:04.897 --> 00:32:07.450
No secrets where you're heading, remember?

00:33:42.924 --> 00:33:44.136
Go.

00:33:46.956 --> 00:33:48.956
I'll clean up this mess.

00:33:52.469 --> 00:33:53.812
Come on.

00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:00.292
Go.

00:35:01.598 --> 00:35:05.364
So, the devil may care after all.
Is that what i'm supposed to believe?

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.580
I don't believe in the devil.

00:35:09.853 --> 00:35:11.694
Wacky night.

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:15.723
So, let me get this straight.

00:35:16.029 --> 00:35:19.879
You were human once. You died,
you went to hell, and you became a...

00:35:20.215 --> 00:35:21.295
Yeah.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.415
How long ago?

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.718
Back when the plague was big.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:33.274
So, all of them every damn demon

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.550
they were all human once?

00:35:39.927 --> 00:35:41.955
Everyone i've ever met.

00:35:42.717 --> 00:35:44.613
Well, they sure don't act like it.

00:35:44.614 --> 00:35:47.120
Most of them have forgotten what it means...

00:35:47.154 --> 00:35:49.164
Or even that they were.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:52.196
That's what happens when
you go to hell, dean.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.134
That's what hell is...

00:35:55.228 --> 00:35:57.416
Forgetting what you are.

00:35:58.575 --> 00:36:01.426
Philosophy lesson from a demon.
I'll pass, thanks.

00:36:01.454 --> 00:36:04.964
It's not philosophy. It's not a metaphor.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:08.098
There's a real fire in the pit,

00:36:08.351 --> 00:36:10.773
agonies you can't even imagine.

00:36:10.774 --> 00:36:13.440
No, i saw "hellraiser. " I get the gist.

00:36:14.263 --> 00:36:16.967
Actually, they got that pretty close...

00:36:17.022 --> 00:36:19.257
Except for all the custom leather.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.720
The answer is yes, by the way.

00:36:28.789 --> 00:36:30.132
Sorry?

00:36:30.243 --> 00:36:32.919
Yes, the same thing will happen to you.

00:36:34.014 --> 00:36:35.966
It might take centuries, but

00:36:35.967 --> 00:36:39.930
sooner or later, hell will
burn away your humanity.

00:36:41.029 --> 00:36:43.283
Every hell-Bound soul,

00:36:43.299 --> 00:36:46.360
everyone, turns into something else.

00:36:46.806 --> 00:36:49.838
Turns you into us, so, yeah...

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.950
Yeah, you can count on it.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:01.310
There's no way of saving
me from the pit, is there?

00:37:03.262 --> 00:37:04.680
No.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.250
Why'd you tell sam that you could?

00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:14.189
So he would talk to me.

00:37:15.228 --> 00:37:17.610
You winchesters can be pretty bigoted,

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:19.750
and i needed something
to help him get past the...

00:37:19.751 --> 00:37:21.310
The demon thing?

00:37:23.607 --> 00:37:25.560
That's pretty hard to get past.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.847
Look at you...

00:37:30.755 --> 00:37:32.558
Trying to be all stoic.

00:37:34.055 --> 00:37:35.989
My god, it's heartbreaking.

00:37:36.019 --> 00:37:37.710
Why are you telling me all this?

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:40.179
I need your help.

00:37:40.216 --> 00:37:42.250
- Help with what?
- With sam.

00:37:43.816 --> 00:37:46.004
The way you stuck that demon tonight

00:37:46.767 --> 00:37:48.673
it was pretty tough.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.528
Sam's almost there, but not quite.

00:37:52.017 --> 00:37:54.374
You need to help me get him ready...

00:37:55.207 --> 00:37:57.291
For life without you.

00:37:57.292 --> 00:38:00.174
To fight this war on his own.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.352
Ruby.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.040
Why do you want us to win?

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.857
Isn't it obvious?

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.211
I'm not like them.

00:38:22.338 --> 00:38:24.253
I don't know why.

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.986
I wish i was, but i'm not.

00:38:28.817 --> 00:38:30.980
I remember what it's like.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.785
What what's like?

00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:35.781
Being human.

00:38:35.809 --> 00:38:39.781
