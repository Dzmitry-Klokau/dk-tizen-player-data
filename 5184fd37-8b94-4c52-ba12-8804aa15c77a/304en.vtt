WEBVTT

00:00:00.985 --> 00:00:02.003
Look, dad's gone now.

00:00:02.038 --> 00:00:04.020
We have to carry out his legacy.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.505
And that means hunting down
as many evil sons of bitches

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:08.206
as we possibly can.

00:00:13.073 --> 00:00:14.324
What the hell
just happened?

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.313
That's a devil's gate,
a damn door to hell!

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:19.483
How certain are you

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:24.026
that what you brought back
is 100% pure Sam?

00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:30.055
Just tell me who you are.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.893
It doesn't matter.

00:00:30.928 --> 00:00:33.549
Just tell me who you are!

00:00:34.114 --> 00:00:35.055
You're a demon.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.598
I want to help you from time to time.

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:37.838
Why would you want to help me?

00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:39.160
I could help you save your brother.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.764
Back in 1835, Samuel Colt made a special gun.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:44.707
This gun can kill anything.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.000
One more.

00:01:37.544 --> 00:01:39.270
That's all for tonight, sister.

00:01:39.646 --> 00:01:41.654
Come on.
Let me walk you to your car.

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:44.802
Father?

00:01:46.403 --> 00:01:47.318
Andy?

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.068
Father, God's not with us.

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:53.700
Not anymore.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.273
Andy, of course he is.

00:01:55.808 --> 00:01:57.360
Why would you say that?
What's wrong?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.643
He can't help us.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.328
And if he can...

00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:03.078
He won't.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.152
Andy, wait!

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.130
Hey, what's up?

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
might have found some omens in ohio.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.360
dry lightning.barometric-pressure drop.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.530
well,that's thrilling.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.200
plus,some guy blows his head off in a church

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.660
and another goes postal in a hobby shop

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.830
before the cops take him out.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.660
might be demonic omens.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.800
or just a suicide and a psycho scrapbooker.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.400
but it's our best lead sinclincoln.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.730
where in ohio? elizabethville.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.100
it's a half-dead factory town in the rust belt.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.930
there's got to be a demon or two in south beach.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.330
sorry,hef. maybe next time.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.700
how's it going,bobby?

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.360
slow.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.330
i tell you,it's a little sad seeing the colt like that.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.030
the only thing it's good for now is figuring out what makes it tick.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.330
so what makes it tick?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.730
so,if we want to go check out these omens in ohio,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.900
you think you can have that thing ready by this afternoon?

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.160
well,it won't kill demons by then,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.200
but i can promise you it'll kill you.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.860
all right. come on,we're wasting the daylight.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.730
- See you, Bobby.
- Hey.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.600
you boys run into anything -- anything -- you call me.

00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:48.160
there's not much left for the insurance company.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.560
it was a suicide.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.830
i saw it myself.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.530
well,this shouldn't take long,then.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.730
that's where andy did it.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.030
it's the first time i'd seen him in weeks.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.630
he used to come every sunday.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.730
when did he stop?

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.060
probably about two months ago

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.060
right around the time everything else started to change.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.160
change how?

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.100
let's just say this used to be a town you could be proud of.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.730
people... cared about each other.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.430
andy sang in the choir,

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.360
and then one day,he just wasn't andy anymore.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.260
it was like he was...

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.160
possessed?

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.900
you could say that.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.060
gambled away his money,cheated on his wife,

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.900
destroyed his business.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.660
Yes.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.500
like a switch had flipped.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.930
father,did you know the man

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.830
who killed those folks in the hobby shop?

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.500
sure,tony perkins.tony perkins.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.200
good man.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.100
would you say that his personality

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.960
suddenly changed one day,too?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.160
i never thought about it that way,but...yes.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.030
about the same time as andy -- about two months ago.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.400
well,thank you,father. appreciate your time.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.900
two months agi,we open up the devil's gate,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.300
all of a sudden this town turns into margaritaville?

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.630
it's no coincidence.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.930
richie.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.360
i don't believe it.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.300
hey.dean...winchester,right?

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.860
this is my sister,uh,cheryl.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.630
hi,cheryl.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.630
there.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.730
well,you know...stepsister.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.330
come on in.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.630
this is my brother,sam.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.430
hey. how you doing? not too bad.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.930
how do you two know each other?

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.230
you were in school.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.930
it was that succubus,right?

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.430
yeah,yeah.oh,man.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.330
you should have seen the rack on this broad.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.930
freakin' tragedy when i had to ganch her.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.060
whoa,whoa. wait.who killed her?

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.860
if i remember,your ass was toast until i showed up.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.930
oh,i forgot what a comedian this guy was.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.130
i told you then.i'll tell you again.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.400
you're not cut out for this job.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.730
you're gonna get yourself killed.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.630
talk to me.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.360
fyi,winchester --words hurt. yeah.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.360
no,it's not a good time,baby.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.000
later.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.860
you find anything in this town,anyway?

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.900
uh,no.i got nothing.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.200
oh,wait a minute. you mean as in demons and whatnot?

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.260
Yeah.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.700
no,i got nothing. typical.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.100
what about your sister back there?

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.660
honestly,she definitely had the devil in her,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.030
but she wasn't no demon,you know what i'm saying?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.860
right. seriously.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.630
church guy,hobby-shop guy --

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.530
they were lunch meat by the time i got there.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.530
maybe they were possessed,but i can't prove it.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.430
yeah,that's where we are,too.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.260
let's just say the demons are possessing people in this town.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.260
you know,raising hell.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.200
but why would a demon blow his brains out?

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.300
for fun? he wrecks one body,moves to another.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.130
like taking a stolen car for a joyride.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.660
anybody else that fits the profile --

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.860
nice guy turned douche that's still breathing?

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.500
there's trotter.who's that?

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.200
he used to be head of the rotary club.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.030
then he turned bastard all of a sudden.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.560
brought in the gambling,the hookers.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.130
he practically owns this whole town.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.230
know where we could find him?

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.500
he'll be at his bar in a few hours.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.160
i thought you said this was some boarded-up factory town.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.330
it is.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.600
at least,it's supposed to be.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.230
well,what are we waiting for? let's do some research.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.030
-oh,richie.look at you. -hey.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.060
-bringing satin back.   -oh,you like this?

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.300
try thai silk -- canal street.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.130
you have to pay $300 for threads like these,easy.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.400
cost to me -- forget about it.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:39.730
how much is "forget about it"?

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.800
ah,forget about it. that's trotter over there.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.200
he sits there all night. can't touch him.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.430
so,what do we do now?

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.500
i don't know about you guys,but i'm gonna do

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.460
a little investigating with that bartender.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.130
easy. me and her,we got a little somethin'-somethin' lined up for later.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.630
yeah,right.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.100
stings,don't it?

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.260
all right. i got to hit the head.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.360
release the hostages.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.730
be back in a few.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.330
no way he gets a girl like that. i mean,look at her.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.860
you could fit that ass on a nickel.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.600
you think so?

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.760
oh. sorry,padre.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.300
knew you boys would find your way here.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.960
they all do.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.130
no offense,but what are you doing here,father?

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.860
like it or not,you go where your flock is.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.360
-plus,the clergy drinks for free.  -true.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.260
and a certain bartender owes me a confession.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.760
not in this lifetime,father.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.130
i better see your butt on sunday.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.100
nickel or no nickel.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.700
what can i get you boys?

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.060
what's your speciality?

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.630
i make a mean hurricane.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.300
i guess we'll see about that.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.230
you drink hurricanes?

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.630
i do now.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.130
hi,john.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.100
reggie. everything okay with you?

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.360
i don't know.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.130
i'm just not feeling myself today.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.130
hey,what are you doing?!

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.100
he slept with my wife.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.260
that bastard slept with my wife!

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.160
somebody call 911!

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.100
too many cops here. i say we roll.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.330
just be cool.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.560
poor jerk. only thing possessing him was a sixer of pabst.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.900
so,what's the deal,then?

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.160
people in this town getting possessed or not?

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.960
i don't know. maybe it is just what it is --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.430
town full of scumbags.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.960
yeah. maybe.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.230
you boys ready for your mug shots?

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.100
the photographer's gonna be here in a few

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.030
and take your picture for the local paper.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.600
be an honor,officer. what a thrill.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.200
yep,time to go.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.030
wait a second. wait a second.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.260
What?

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.800
where's richie?

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.360
so,how's a bartender afford a place like this?

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.930
my parents left it to me.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.400
i don't come out here much --

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.330
mostly when i want to be alone.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.260
wow. this is,uh,charming.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.100
you sure you wouldn't be more comfortable

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.400
in a bedroom or my motel room?

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.300
i mean,not for nothing,but,you know,i got oils.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.860
but i have toys.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.930
yeah,no. toys trump oils.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.230
you don't get,uh,scared down here all by yourself?

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.630
of course not.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.300
not when i've got a hunter to protect me.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.423
Thanks.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.810
you do realize there's red meat

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.010
within striking distance,right?

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.480
how many times i got to tell richie

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.950
he's gonna get himself in trouble?

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.180
dean,you're assuming he's missing.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.980
i mean,maybe he just bailed.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.080
he's a moron.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.250
he's a sweet moron,but he's not a coward.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.480
he wouldn't just bail. i got to go find him.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.910
meanwhile,i think i'm gonna trail this trotter guy.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.180
yeah?

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.050
I don't know. something about the way he looked at me last night.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.550
maybe there is something going on here.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.250
cute piece.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.950
who are you?

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.850
it won't stop a demon,if that's what you think.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.280
how the hell would you know?

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.410
oh,i don't know.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.210
call it an educated guess.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.050
well,ain't i lucky,then?

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.380
found a subject for a test fire.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.650
luck has nothing to do with it.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.110
but,hey,by all means.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.010
take your best shot.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.710
are you gonna stand there like a pantywaist,

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.950
or are you gonna shoot me?!

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.580
that smarts a little.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.880
what do you want?

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.710
peace on earth.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.250
a new shirt.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.410
now...do you want me to help you out with that gun or not?

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.850
-dean.  -sammy.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.110
-yeah. hey. i can't talk right now.   -you okay?

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.550
Yeah,i'm fine.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.580
just meet me at the bar in 20 minutes,okay?

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:44.950
sam!

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.080
i got to tell you --

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:10.410
every woman in this place -- they want to eat you up.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.650
anybody could have tackled that guy

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.350
and wrestled the gun away... prevented mass murder.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.550
here's what i'm gonna do.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.680
normally,i charge $400 a night.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.850
why don't we call it an even deuce

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.350
and get the hell out of here?

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.710
what do i look like?

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.910
what do i look like?

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:39.950
cheapskate.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.350
did i just see you strike out with a prostitute?

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.650
how's that work?

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.580
i just told her i had a thing for the bartender.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.710
it was pretty easy.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.580
who says the bartender's available?

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.280
that's a good question.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:00.410
you got something going with some guy about yea tall,

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.880
wears a sweat suit?who?

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.350
no. my mistake.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.010
what do you say you and me grab a drink after your shift?

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.980
i say why wait...when we can go right now?

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.080
what are you doing here?

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.750
i think maybe you know.yeah?

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.050
well,i think i'm calling the cops.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.150
cops?

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.910
breaking and entering,assault --

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.950
you're in a peck of trouble,my friend.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.050
uh,well,i think i could probably explain it!

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.650
all right,back up!

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.010
get back.money's in the safe!take it and go.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.910
i don't want your money.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.080
i just got to be sure.

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:20.550
what kind of psycho are you?

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:21.950
oh,god.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.780
uh,i'm sorry.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.210
i think this was just a minor  misunderstanding?

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.610
how 'bout i just leave,cause...

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.580
you know,i'll take these.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:39.380
i'll,uh,i'll leave this for,uh...

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:43.550
you,uh...have a nice day?

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.650
looks like the maid's day off.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.350
everything okay?

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.580
make yourself comfortable.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.010
oh,i forgot to mention...

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.410
richie was a friend of mine.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.980
when i realized i could track the gps in his cellphone,

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.410
i swung by earlier.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.450
give him a proper burial.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.780
it's better than rotting in some skank's basement.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.750
whoops.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.550
tsk,tsk,tsk.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.110
isn't that a buzz kill?

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.110
sorry,sister,

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.650
but you're going back to where you came from.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.680
i don't think so.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.510
what are you laughing at,bitch?

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.880
you're still trapped.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.080
so are you...bitch.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.410
lose something?

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.540
all you demons have such smart mouths.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.610
it's a gift.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.740
well,let's see if you're smiling

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.440
when i send your ass back to hell.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.110
without your little exorcism book?

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.270
hey,go ahead.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.810
having a little trouble there,sport?

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:34.670
nice try,but i think you just ordered a pizza.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.670
i guess you should have paid more attention in latin class.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.370
i don't know what you're smiling about.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.510
you're not going anywhere.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.810
and,apparently,neither are you.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.970
yeah,but i got somebody coming for me,and,uh...

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.710
he did pay attention in class.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.510
oh,right -- sam.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.940
everyone says he's the brains of the outfit.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.010
-everyone?  -sure.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.840
you winchester boys are famous.

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.710
not lohan famous,but,you know...

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.940
well,that's flattering.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.970
i'll be sure to let sam know when he gets here.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.040
if he shows up first.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.870
what,you thought i was flying solo?

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.170
you shouldn't underestimate,dean.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.310
it might be the death of you.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.440
you can give me hard eyes all you want,

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.670
but the fact remains,

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.340
we just have to wait and see who shows up first --

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.470
the cavalry or the indians.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.470
you look kind of tense.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:45.010
you know,i know a surefire way to relax.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.610
maybe later.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.640
excuse me.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.210
what can i get for you?

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.340
um,you remember the guy i was with last night?

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.970
we sat right here.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.410
the big hero who jumped on reggie.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.270
yeah,yeah. the -- the big hero. right.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.240
um,have you seen him around at all today?

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.370
maybe. depends.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.040
d-depends on what?

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.240
oh,my --

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.470
does everyone around here have their hand out?

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.270
he left with casey about an hour ago.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.010
any idea where they went?

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.870
her place...for bible study.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.840
-you got an address?  -what's wrong with you?

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.870
you think i'm gonna give you a co-worker's address

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.170
just so you can go over there

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.910
and get your freaky peeping-tom rocks off?

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.940
corner of piermont and clinton.

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.570
have fun.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.560
why don't you relax?

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:51.920
why don't you kiss my ass?

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.020
why,dean,you're a poet.i had no idea.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.520
look,we won't have any effect on the outcome of this.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.860
we might as well be civil.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.120
civil,huh?

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.260
killing richie --that was civil?

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.690
the guy was harmless.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.590
that knife he pulled on me didn't look so harmless.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.090
a knife wouldn't hurt you.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.660
no,but it would damage this body.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.220
and casey has such a fine body,

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.520
i wouldn't want to see it ripped.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.690
a demon with a heart. wow.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.390
well,you know,there's a bunch of dead people in town

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.620
that might disagree with you.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.190
hey,i didn't pull any triggers.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.890
yeah,you did something.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.520
you want to know what i did -- what i really did?

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.860
i had lunch.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.790
-lunch?  -me and trotter.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.920
he had a cheeseburger,i had a salad,

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.320
and i just pointed out the money that could be made

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.390
with a few businesses that cater to harmless vice.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.820
so trotter built it,and,man,did they come.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.360
supposedly god-fearing folk,

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.120
waist-deep in booze,sex,gambling.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.920
i barely lifted a finger.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.760
-that's it?  -you don't get it.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:57.460
all you got to do is nudge humans in the right direction.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.020
some whiskey here,a hooker there,

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.860
and they'll walk right into hell

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:03.790
with big,fat smiles on their faces.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.160
your kind is corrupt,dean. weak.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:12.820
our will's stronger.that's why we'll win.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.660
and that's how it ends?

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.520
no.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.160
that's how it begins.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.190
dean?

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.020
sulfur.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.160
so,demons take over.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.060
i thought the meek shall inherit the earth.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.090
oh,according to your bible.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:05.260
it's only a book,dean.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.790
not everyone would agree.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.260
because it's god's book?

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.820
do you believe in god,dean?

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.260
i'd be surprised if you did.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.120
i don't know.i'd like to.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.420
well,i don't see how you and your god

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.290
have done such a bang-up job.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.160
war,genocide --it's only getting worse.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.760
this past century,

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:32.160
you people racked up a body count that amazed even us.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.120
it's our turn now,

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.890
and we're gonna do it right this time.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.860
don't be hopeful,dean.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:44.790
you're not delivered.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.560
it's only the wind.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.160
bobby,it's sam.we got a big problem.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.320
i found some sulfur,and now i can't find dean.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.720
call me as soon as you get this.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.420
hey,excuse me.they weren't there.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.820
i guess you got to catch your jollies another night.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:03.060
here. why don't you have a drink and relax?

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.920
I don't want to relax.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.820
what is it with the people in this town?

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.060
suit yourself,princess.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.620
father.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.820
yes?

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.720
um...can i talk to you for a sec?

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.820
you're piling it pretty high there,sweetheart.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:28.890
i'm not sure i'm buying.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.960
why would i lie?

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:32.060
demons lie.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.060
some do.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:36.390
some are true believers.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.620
believers in what?

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.020
you think humans have an exclusive on a higher power?

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.990
you have a god?

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.690
sure.his name's lucifer.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.720
you mean the devil?

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.720
your word,not ours.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.620
lucifer actually means "light bringer."

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.920
look it up.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.120
once he was the most beautiful of all god's angels.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.590
but god demanded that he bow down before man,

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.720
and when he refused,god banished him.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.960
tell me,dean.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.160
how do you like bowing before lesser creatures?

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.690
lucifer's really real?

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.420
well,no one's actually seen him,

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.520
but they say that he made us into what we are,

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.020
and they say that he'll return.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.560
oh,yeah? and,uh,you believe that?

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.790
i've got faith.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.420
so,you see?

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.420
is my kind really all that different than yours?

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.660
well,except that,uh,demons are evil.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:26.220
and humans are such a lovable bunch.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.290
dick cheney.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.890
-he one of yours?  -not yet.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.460
let's just say he's got a parking spot reserved for him downstairs.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.560
.
hey,speaking of downstairs...

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.960
what's it like down there?

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.190
what,hell?

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.620
yeah.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.820
that's right.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.660
you booked a one-way ticket with that deal.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.890
you're not gonna like it,dean.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.360
and,um,judging from the trouble you've caused,

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.060
i don't think you'll be getting the presidential suite.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.660
no,it's a pit of despair.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.260
why do you think we want to come here?

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.790
so,the -- the bartender the other night,casey,

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.590
you know her pretty well?

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.960
since she was in pigtails.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:19.260
well,um,she and my brother,they,uh...

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.720
they...left tonight.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.190
together.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.920
well,not that i approve,but they are consenting adults.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.960
right.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:32.890
i'm sorry.you said "brother."

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.690
i thought you were insurance investigators.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.320
right,right. well,we are.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.420
um,it's like a family business,you know?

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.220
anyways,um,so,i went to casey's apartment,

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.690
and they weren't there.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.760
um,i just have this feeling that they --

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.520
that they might be in trouble.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.060
what kind of trouble?

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.160
just trouble.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.260
please,father,i need your help.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:57.020
is there anything you could tell me about casey --

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.360
anyplace she'd go,maybe?

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.490
yes,there is a place. let me get my jacket.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.760
no,wait,father. i can do this by myself.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.490
son,if casey's really in trouble,

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.290
then there's nothing to talk about.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.720
shall we go?

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.880
kind of funny,don't you think?

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.320
you and me sitting here like a couple of regular folk.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.920
it's hilarious --

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.350
you know,in that apocalyptic sort of way.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.920
you're all right,dean.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.020
the others don't describe you that way.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.920
but,you know,you're -- you're likable.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.450
a demon likes me.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.380
sorry,i don't know how to respond to that.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.780
you could say thanks.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.520
that deal you made to save sam --

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.120
a lot of others would mock you for it,

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.480
think it was weak or stupid.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.820
i don't.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.250
it's been kind of liberating,actually.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.380
what's the point in worrying about a future

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.280
when you don't have one,huh?

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.580
still,a year left.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.880
you're not scared?

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.520
not even a little?

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.120
of course not.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.180
so,insurance investigating.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.250
you enjoy the work?

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.650
yeah.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.320
yeah,i...like being able to help people.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.820
ever think about doing anything else?

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.050
like what?

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.320
mmm,anything.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.880
you seem like a pretty smart kid.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:45.420
somehow i see you out in front of the pack.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.450
you could do some great things.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.920
i don't know.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.950
i like doing what i'm doing,i guess.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.380
well,it's your life.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:00.650
does,um...

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.680
dean?

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.880
yeah,dean.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.320
does he find trouble often?

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.250
yeah yeah,dean finds his fair share.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.150
well,it's a good thing he has you --

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.250
his brother's keeper.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.650
why,dean,if i didn't know better,

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.220
i'd say that was lust in your eyes.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.480
well,it would be one way to spend the time.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.380
but i don't think you'd respect me in the morning.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.820
that's okay.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.550
i mean,hey,i barely respect you now.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.650
hey,can i ask you a question?

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.020
i'm an open book.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.320
so,the gate opened. the demon army was let out.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.280
what now,huh?

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.420
i'm not seeing a big,honking plan here.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.620
honestly,there was a plan.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.650
azazel was a tyrant,

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.980
but he held us all together.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.220
azazel?

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:06.220
you think his friends
just called him yellow eyes?

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.050
he had a name.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.550
after you did him in,it all fell apart.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.050
sorry about that.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.680
so,what?no chain of command?

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.180
There was.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.520
it was sam.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.650
sam was supposed to be the grand pooh-bah

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.320
and lead the big army,

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.380
but he hasn't exactly stepped up to the plate,has he?

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.350
thank god for that.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.880
again with god.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.180
you think this is a good thing?

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.850
now you've got chaos,

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.320
a war without a front,

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.220
hundreds of demons all jockeying for power,

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.320
all fighting for the crown...

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:44.580
most of them gunning for your brother.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.820
for the record,i was ready to follow sam.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.280
dean?!

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.250
looks like you win

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.550
dean!

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.750
check that way

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.480
sam!

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.620
dean?

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.750
sammy,down here! the basement caved in!

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.620
dean. hey,hold on,okay? we're coming.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.350
-who's we? -i'm here with the father.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.950
sammy,be careful.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.580
-bobby,you all right? -yeah.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.050
how did you know where we...

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.880
go.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.750
you heard the man. go.

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.550
stop!

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.980
you two?

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.550
for centuries.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.880
we've been to hell and back,literally.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.520
leave him be.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.780
don't kill him. let's just go.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.120
please.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.480
sam,wait!

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.160
well,what do you think,bobby?

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:10.020
what we did here,you think it made a difference?

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.260
two less demons to worry about.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:13.560
that's not nothing

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.290
but trotter's still alive.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.660
humans ain't our job.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.390
yeah,but you think anything's really gonna change?

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.560
maybe these people do just want to really destroy themselves.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:27.660
maybe it is a losing battle.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.290
is that you or the demon girl talking?

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.190
oh,it's me.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.520
demon is dead,and so is that hot girl it was possessing.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.690
well,had to be done. sam was saving your life.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.090
yeah,but you didn'ts ee it,bobby. it was cold.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.590
bobby.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.920
yeah?

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.860
back in wyoming,

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:50.890
uh,there was this moment

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.160
yellow eyes said something to me.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.060
what did he say?

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.590
that maybe when sam came back

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:05.520
from wherever that...

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.860
maybe he came back different.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:09.520
-different how? -i don't know.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.420
whatever it was,it didn't sound good.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.660
you think...

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:17.720
think something's wrong with my brother?

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.390
no.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.720
demons lie.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.820
i'm sure sam's okay.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.260
yeah.

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.620
yeah,me too.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.690
leaving so soon?

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.290
we haven't even had a chance to celebrate.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.920
yeah,well,you can celebrate without me.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.020
you're not gonna get all pouty on me now,are you?

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.360
come on!

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:55.760
you killed two demons today.

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.290
yeah,well,maybe you don't care,

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.860
but i killed two humans,too.

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.260
sam,you know what happens when demons piggyback humans.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:09.490
chances are those two would have died a slow,sticky death.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.160
you probably did them a favor.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.720
did them a favor?

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:15.020
you're a cold bitch,you know that?

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.560
yeah,and this cold bitch.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.890
has saved your ass a couple of times now.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.590
some respect might be nice.

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:25.460
especially if you want me to help you out...

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.020
with dean and his little problem.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.990
you know what? you keep dangling that,

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.360
but last i checked,dean's still going to hell.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:34.260
everything in its own time,sam.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.060
-we're in a war. -right.

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.190
but for some reason,you're fighting on our team.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.660
now,tell me,why is that again?

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:43.020
go screw yourself. that's why.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.890
i don't have to justify my actions to you,sam.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.320
if you don't want my help,fine.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.390
then give me the gun,

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.320
and i'll pass it on to someone who will use it.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.760
maybe i'll just use it on you.

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.060
go ahead,if that makes you happy.

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.460
it's not gonna do much for dean,though.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.290
so,what's it gonna be?

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.160
that's my boy.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.490
this won't be easy,sam.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.990
you're gonna have to do things

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.390
that go against that gentlnature of yours.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.660
there'll be collateral damage...

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.320
but, it has to be done.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.760
well,i don't have to like it.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.790
no.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:36.860
you wouldn't be sam if you did.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:41.960
on the bright side,i'll be there with you

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:46.360
that little fall angel

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:49.360
on your shoulder.
