00:00.500 --> 00:01.880
I got a year to live, sam.


00:01.890 --> 00:03.110
I'd like to make the most of it.


00:04.700 --> 00:08.480
So what do you say we kill some evil sons
of bitches and we raise a little hell?


00:09.430 --> 00:11.060
THEN


00:11.070 --> 00:12.560
You didn't tell dean? Tell me what?


00:12.570 --> 00:13.890
There's a big new up-and-comer.


00:13.900 --> 00:14.760
Her name is lilith.


00:14.770 --> 00:18.080
She really, really wants sam's
intestines on a stick.


00:18.090 --> 00:19.920
Let dean out of his deal right now.


00:19.930 --> 00:21.070
I'm just a saleswoman.


00:21.080 --> 00:22.530
I got a boss like everybody.


00:22.540 --> 00:23.780
Who holds the contract?


00:23.790 --> 00:25.220
I can't tell you.


00:26.950 --> 00:28.710
Bela talbot's her real name.


00:28.750 --> 00:29.710
The colt.


00:29.730 --> 00:31.100
Bela stole the colt.


00:31.110 --> 00:32.170
I want it back, bela.


00:32.180 --> 00:33.650
Your little pistol, you mean?


00:33.760 --> 00:34.360
Sorry.


00:34.370 --> 00:36.810
You understand how many people
are gonna die if you do this?


00:36.820 --> 00:39.130
What exactly is it that you think
I plan to do with it?


00:39.140 --> 00:43.260
Take the only weapon we have against an army
of demons and sell it to the highest bidder.


00:43.410 --> 00:44.660
You know nothing about me.


00:44.690 --> 00:45.830
- Pack your crap.
- Why?


00:45.850 --> 00:46.840
Where are we going?


00:46.860 --> 00:48.050
We're gonna go hunt the bitch down.


00:48.070 --> 00:49.080
I don't want to go to hell.


00:49.100 --> 00:50.230
We'll find a way to save you.


00:50.250 --> 00:51.560
I'm scared, sam.


00:51.570 --> 00:52.830
I'm really scared.


00:52.850 --> 00:55.670
And the only person that can get
me out of this thing is me.


00:55.720 --> 00:57.270
And me.


00:57.610 --> 01:00.120
NOW


01:06.080 --> 01:07.085
Up for a drink?


01:07.120 --> 01:09.526
No, I can't.
I got to be up at the cracky down.


01:09.561 --> 01:10.688
Duty calls.


01:11.080 --> 01:13.149
- Boob job?
- I wish.


01:13.184 --> 01:15.829
Nah, some crabby old broad
wants the works.


01:15.880 --> 01:17.653
I need a forklift to get it all back up.


01:17.680 --> 01:20.580
All that work to have what?
15 minutes off her faces?


01:20.615 --> 01:22.436
Staying young is a brutal business.


01:59.880 --> 02:00.675
Hey!


02:01.988 --> 02:03.020
Help!


02:07.583 --> 02:09.034
Let me out of here!


02:09.726 --> 02:11.343
Help!


02:22.990 --> 02:24.985
- Sir?
- Please.


02:25.989 --> 02:28.212
It's okay, sir.
Let me see what happened.


02:30.128 --> 02:32.551
Don't you worry.
There's nothing I haven't seen.


02:33.088 --> 02:35.371
- No, no, no...
- Let me see...


02:43.280 --> 02:46.380
Transcript : www.1000fr.com
Synchro : Flolo


02:52.587 --> 02:53.641
Stop!


02:54.088 --> 02:55.482
You ready to talk?


02:57.755 --> 02:58.950
I don't know.


02:59.288 --> 03:00.983
I don't know anything!


03:01.025 --> 03:03.063
Oh, you hear that, Sam?
He doesn't know anything.


03:03.087 --> 03:04.363
Yeah, I heard.


03:04.387 --> 03:05.690
I'm telling you the truth.


03:05.726 --> 03:06.781
Oh, you are?


03:06.886 --> 03:09.061
My god,
then I owe you an apology.


03:09.087 --> 03:10.751
Allow me to make it up to you.


03:18.888 --> 03:20.981
I'm gonna ask you one last time...


03:21.388 --> 03:23.271
Who holds my contract?!


03:35.485 --> 03:36.783
Your mother.


03:38.688 --> 03:41.773
Yeah, she, uh, showed it to me
right before I bent her over.


03:46.285 --> 03:48.031
I want a name.


03:48.555 --> 03:50.161
- Or else...
- Or what?


03:51.486 --> 03:54.290
You're gonna squirt
your holy water in both ends?


03:54.786 --> 03:56.301
Please.


03:56.385 --> 03:59.091
Brother, that's like a fleabite
compared to what's coming to me


03:59.137 --> 04:00.811
if I tell you jack.


04:03.486 --> 04:04.852
Do what you want.


04:04.888 --> 04:08.982
The only thing I'm scared
is the demon holding your ticket.


04:23.506 --> 04:25.171
How does that feel?
Does that feel good?


04:27.486 --> 04:28.780
Go ahead.


04:30.085 --> 04:31.932
Send me back to hell...


04:32.988 --> 04:35.163
'Cause when you get there,
I'll be waiting for you...


04:36.088 --> 04:37.613
With a few pals who are dying


04:37.616 --> 04:40.541
for a nice little meet and greet
Dean Winchester.


04:42.986 --> 04:44.121
Should I?


04:44.788 --> 04:47.371
Send him someplace
he can't hurt anyone else.


05:00.588 --> 05:02.333
You ran the prints twice?


05:02.385 --> 05:03.620
Are you sure?


05:05.586 --> 05:08.750
Okay. Yeah,
just chalk it up to lab error.


05:09.888 --> 05:11.481
Don't I know it. Okay.


05:11.586 --> 05:13.500
Thanks.
Yeah, I'll tell the lieutenant.


05:14.087 --> 05:15.281
Bury the body?


05:15.586 --> 05:17.110
Yeah.


05:17.378 --> 05:19.971
Looks like these demons
ride 'em hard just for kicks.


05:23.888 --> 05:25.333
What was the phone call about?


05:25.385 --> 05:27.142
Remember that thing in the paper yesterday?


05:27.187 --> 05:29.482
"Stripper suffocates dude with thighs"?


05:29.527 --> 05:30.652
The other thing.


05:30.686 --> 05:32.642
Right,
the guy that walks into the E.R.


05:32.677 --> 05:34.532
and kneels over dead.
His stomach's ripped out?


05:34.655 --> 05:36.643
His liver, actually.
Anyways, I just found out


05:36.666 --> 05:38.710
- something pretty damn interesting.
- What?


05:38.786 --> 05:41.952
The dead body covered
in bloody fingerprints, not the victim's.


05:42.986 --> 05:45.621
Okay, great. My man Dave Caruso
will be stoked to hear it.


05:45.666 --> 05:49.770
Those fingerprints match a guy
who died in 1981.


05:50.585 --> 05:51.583
Really?


05:52.566 --> 05:54.282
So, what are we talking?


05:54.328 --> 05:56.512
Uh, walking dead? Walking, killing dead?


05:56.588 --> 05:57.660
Maybe.


05:58.086 --> 06:00.591
Zombies do like the other other white meat.


06:03.886 --> 06:05.780
Speaking of,
what do you care about zombies?


06:05.886 --> 06:06.770
What do you mean?


06:06.798 --> 06:08.581
Well, you've been on soul-saving detail
for months now.


06:08.626 --> 06:10.521
And we're three weeks out,
and all of a sudden,


06:10.567 --> 06:12.260
you're interested
in some hot zombie action?


06:12.287 --> 06:14.463
Hey, man, you're the one
who's been all gung ho to hunt.


06:14.496 --> 06:16.593
- I just thought I'd be doing you a favor.
- Hey, no, no, no, no, no.


06:16.685 --> 06:19.431
I didn't say I didn't want to do it, okay.
I mean obviously


06:19.475 --> 06:23.171
- I want to hunt some zombies.
- Okay, fine, whatever.


06:29.388 --> 06:32.092
Yeah, the rest of the body was intact.


06:32.126 --> 06:34.252
The liver was the only organ missing.


06:34.787 --> 06:36.260
Now, where the liver was ripped out,


06:36.307 --> 06:38.790
did you happen to notice any teeth marks?


06:39.685 --> 06:41.321
Can I see your badges?


06:41.385 --> 06:42.633
Of course, sure.


06:46.585 --> 06:49.890
- Fine. So you're cops and morons.
- Excuse me?


06:49.926 --> 06:53.241
- No, no. We're very smart.
- The liver was not ripped out.


07:00.287 --> 07:01.980
It was removed.


07:01.988 --> 07:03.781
Surgically.


07:03.888 --> 07:06.380
By someone who knew
their way around a scalpel.


07:08.586 --> 07:10.521
Didn't you read my report?


07:11.076 --> 07:13.572
Of course we did. Oh, it was riveting.


07:13.585 --> 07:15.911
It was a real page-turner, just delightful.


07:17.086 --> 07:18.672
- You done?
- I think so.


07:18.697 --> 07:20.291
Please go away.


07:20.336 --> 07:21.521
Sure.


07:27.088 --> 07:28.151
What?


07:28.755 --> 07:29.630
Nothing.


07:29.687 --> 07:31.971
So, that kind of punches a hole
in our zombie theory, huh,


07:32.007 --> 07:33.042
that scalpel thing?


07:33.086 --> 07:36.040
Yeah, zombie with skills,
"Dr. Quinn, medicine zombie".


07:36.886 --> 07:38.161
Maybe we're on the wrong track, Dean,


07:38.196 --> 07:39.711
looking for hacked-up corpses.


07:39.787 --> 07:41.413
What should we be looking for?


07:41.488 --> 07:42.881
Survivors.


07:42.915 --> 07:45.223
This isn't zombie lunch.
This is organ theft.


07:46.487 --> 07:48.943
I told the cops all of this yesterday.


07:48.985 --> 07:50.683
I don't want to talk about it anymore.


07:50.726 --> 07:52.430
It's just a couple of questions, sir.


07:52.477 --> 07:53.673
Hey, man.


07:54.087 --> 07:56.261
I just got my kidney stolen.


07:57.086 --> 07:58.403
I'm tired.


07:58.486 --> 08:00.850
We'll be out of here quick.
Don't you want to get the guy?


08:00.886 --> 08:02.930
Will it get me back my kidney?


08:04.486 --> 08:06.512
So what's the last thing you remember?


08:06.586 --> 08:08.041
Feeding my meter.


08:09.637 --> 08:11.420
He jumped from behind...


08:11.457 --> 08:14.671
and then I wake up strapped to a table.


08:14.687 --> 08:19.932
And then the worst pain
you could possibly imagine, only worse.


08:20.587 --> 08:23.550
And then I black out again.
Thank god.


08:23.587 --> 08:25.811
And then I wake up screaming


08:25.886 --> 08:28.103
in some no-tell motel


08:28.136 --> 08:30.782
in a bathtub full of ice.


08:31.085 --> 08:32.783
Do you remember anything
about the surgery know,


08:32.807 --> 08:35.612
what the guy looked like,
any details about the room?


08:36.386 --> 08:38.052
Let me think about that.


08:38.088 --> 08:39.401
Yeah...


08:40.086 --> 08:43.602
One thing is coming back to me.
You know what I remember?


08:43.688 --> 08:46.153
Getting my kidney cut out of my body!


08:52.685 --> 08:54.662
- So, I got a theory.
- Yeah?


08:54.687 --> 08:56.422
Yeah, I talked to Mr. Giggle's doctor.


08:56.458 --> 08:58.912
Turns out his incisions
were sewn up with silk.


08:59.187 --> 09:01.242
- That's weird.
- Yeah, nowadays it is,


09:01.286 --> 09:03.342
but silk used to be the suture of choice


09:03.375 --> 09:06.180
back in the early 19th century.
It was really problematic.


09:06.218 --> 09:07.930
Patients would get massive infections.


09:07.986 --> 09:10.003
The death rate was insane.


09:10.085 --> 09:11.232
- Good times.
- Right,


09:11.245 --> 09:13.170
so doctors,
they had to do whatever they could


09:13.208 --> 09:14.680
to keep infections from spreading.


09:14.783 --> 09:17.024
- One way was maggots.
- Dude, I'm eating.


09:17.066 --> 09:19.483
It actually kind of worked
because maggots, they eat bad tissue,


09:19.510 --> 09:22.315
and they leave good tissue.
And get this. When they found our guy,


09:22.349 --> 09:25.893
- his body cavity was stuffed full of maggots.
- Dude, I'm eating.


09:25.926 --> 09:27.493
Alright let me get this straight.


09:28.586 --> 09:30.582
- So, people are getting ganked, right?
- Yeah.


09:30.628 --> 09:33.252
A little "antiques roadshow" surgery,
some organ theft.


09:33.298 --> 09:35.713
- But why does that sound familiar?
- Because you heard it before.


09:35.787 --> 09:38.390
When you we a kid... from dad.


09:40.588 --> 09:42.101
Doc Benton...


09:42.108 --> 09:44.413
real-life doctor, lived in New Hampshire,


09:44.445 --> 09:46.622
brilliant and obsessed with alchemy,


09:46.685 --> 09:49.281
especially how to live forever.


09:49.386 --> 09:52.071
So, in 1816,
doc abandons his practice and...


09:52.086 --> 09:54.441
Right, yeah, nobody hears from him
for like 20 years,


09:54.486 --> 09:56.063
and all of sudden,
people start showing up dead.


09:56.148 --> 09:59.470
Dead or missing an organ
or the hand or some other kind of part.


09:59.488 --> 10:01.450
'Cause whatever he was doing
was actually working.


10:01.486 --> 10:04.271
He just kept on ticking.
Parts would wear out, he'd replace them.


10:04.285 --> 10:06.500
But I thought dad hunted him down
and took his heart out.


10:06.585 --> 10:09.412
Yeah, I guess doc
must have plugged in a new one.


10:10.886 --> 10:12.541
All right, where's he doing the deed?


10:12.586 --> 10:15.380
According to this, Ben's picky
about where he sets up his lab.


10:15.488 --> 10:18.672
He likes dense forest
with access to a river or stream


10:18.686 --> 10:20.290
- or some kind of freshwater.
- Why?


10:20.388 --> 10:23.763
Because that's where he likes
to dump the bile


10:23.808 --> 10:26.552
and intestines and fecal matter.


10:27.586 --> 10:29.022
Lost your appetite yet?


10:32.627 --> 10:34.593
Maybe I can stay mad at you.


12:07.496 --> 12:09.350
No please.


12:11.217 --> 12:12.472
No.


12:22.036 --> 12:24.572
No, no.


12:51.270 --> 12:53.050
So these are all the cabins.


12:53.329 --> 12:54.993
They most have been abandonned
for years.


12:55.028 --> 12:56.493
So what the hell
are we waiting for?


13:06.669 --> 13:08.692
They got finally got a bate on Bella.


13:08.739 --> 13:09.924
I'm listenning.


13:09.929 --> 13:11.355
Rufus Turner.


13:11.390 --> 13:13.075
Who's that? Like a Cleveland steamer?


13:13.118 --> 13:15.384
He's a hunter,
or he used to be.


13:15.427 --> 13:16.424
And now?


13:16.458 --> 13:18.874
Permit mostly.
Doesn't want selling on the side.


13:18.920 --> 13:19.823
Anyway.


13:19.880 --> 13:22.215
I put the word out on Bella
months ago.


13:22.220 --> 13:25.082
He just called.
Said a woman got in touch,


13:25.117 --> 13:26.603
wanted to buy some things.


13:26.640 --> 13:27.964
And he thinks it's Bella?


13:28.030 --> 13:30.552
British accent, went by the name
Mina Chandler.


13:30.598 --> 13:31.872
She's used that before.


13:32.559 --> 13:33.942
Well, it's kinda of a sloppy move


13:33.990 --> 13:35.972
in getting in contact
with one of your old friends.


13:36.009 --> 13:39.044
A friend? ???
in fifteen years.


13:39.080 --> 13:41.275
He's not the christmas card type.


13:41.307 --> 13:43.415
I doubt she knows I know him.


13:43.727 --> 13:45.432
Canaan, Vermont.


13:45.440 --> 13:48.034
- Thanks, Bobby. We're on our way.
- One other thing.


13:48.038 --> 13:50.354
Take a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.


13:50.357 --> 13:51.614
Okay.


13:52.749 --> 13:54.425
- Come on. We're going after Bella.
- What?


13:54.467 --> 13:57.185
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.
- Come on. Would you stop? The clock's ticking.


13:57.220 --> 13:59.695
Look, I think we should stay here
and finish the cakes.


13:59.739 --> 14:02.193
- You're insane?
- Dean, there's no way she still has the colt!


14:02.200 --> 14:04.855
There was months ago! She probably
sold it the second she got it.


14:05.110 --> 14:06.993
Well, then I'll kill her.
Win-win.


14:08.029 --> 14:09.175
We're going!


14:09.938 --> 14:11.485
- No.
- Why the hell not?


14:11.530 --> 14:13.774
Dean, this is here. Now.


14:13.819 --> 14:15.605
This is what's gonna save you.


14:15.649 --> 14:17.504
What? Chasing some Frankenstein?


14:17.509 --> 14:19.124
Chasing immortality.


14:21.650 --> 14:23.273
Look, Benton can't die.


14:23.307 --> 14:25.552
We find out how he did,
we can do it to you.


14:25.598 --> 14:28.114
- What are you talking about?
- You have to die before you go to hell, right?


14:28.208 --> 14:31.052
- So, if you can never die, then...
- Wait, wait, wait. What are you saying?


14:33.730 --> 14:36.083
Did you know that this was ???
from the jump?


14:36.950 --> 14:38.135
No.


14:40.057 --> 14:42.543
- Look, I was hoping.
- So the whole zombie thing,


14:42.560 --> 14:43.953
- it was lying to me?
- I don't wanna say anything


14:43.960 --> 14:45.534
until we're sure, Dean.
All I'm trying to do


14:45.580 --> 14:46.703
is find an answer here.


14:46.739 --> 14:48.644
No. What you're trying to do is chase


14:48.679 --> 14:51.374
slicy here.
And to kill him?


14:51.379 --> 14:54.062
No. You wanna buy him
a freaking beer. You wanna study him.


14:54.097 --> 14:55.902
- I was just trying to help.
- You're not helping!


14:55.918 --> 14:57.984
You forget that if I ???
on this deal,


14:57.987 --> 14:59.175
you die.


14:59.177 --> 15:00.814
Guess what?
Living forever is well...


15:00.818 --> 15:03.103
Fine! Then, whatever the magic pill is,
I'll take it too!


15:03.107 --> 15:06.283
Oh, what is it? Sid and Nancy?
No. It's just like Bobby was saying.


15:06.290 --> 15:07.902
We kill the demon who owns the contract,


15:07.910 --> 15:10.472
and this whole damn thing gets clean.
That's our best shot.


15:10.488 --> 15:12.433
Even if you had the colt, Dean,
who you're gonna shoot?


15:12.440 --> 15:14.052
We've no idea
who holds the ticket.


15:14.058 --> 15:16.422
I'll shoot the whole hellhouse
before they slash me up.


15:16.438 --> 15:18.632
- Now, you're coming or not?
- I'm staying here.


15:20.389 --> 15:21.672
No, you're not.


15:21.677 --> 15:24.184
'Cause I'm not gonna let you
wander out in the woods alone


15:24.188 --> 15:26.665
to track some older stealing freak.


15:26.668 --> 15:28.633
- Look, let me...
- No, I'm not gonna let you.


15:28.637 --> 15:30.045
How are you gonna stop me?


15:31.907 --> 15:33.545
Look, man,


15:33.549 --> 15:35.673
we're trying to do the same thing here.


15:39.267 --> 15:40.572
I know.


15:45.399 --> 15:46.895
But I'm going.


15:48.110 --> 15:49.892
So if you wanna stay...


15:50.747 --> 15:51.695
stay.


16:09.100 --> 16:10.545
Sammy, be careful.


16:14.740 --> 16:15.672
You too.


16:47.289 --> 16:48.682
What?


16:48.690 --> 16:51.332
Hi, uh, Rufus?


16:51.337 --> 16:52.514
Yeah, even if I am,


16:52.529 --> 16:54.823
the question is still the same.
What?


16:55.957 --> 16:58.554
Uh, I'm Dean Winchester.
I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's.


16:58.600 --> 16:59.602
So?


17:00.108 --> 17:01.605
You called him this morning.


17:01.710 --> 17:02.724
So?


17:04.810 --> 17:07.024
Uh, you told Bobby


17:07.110 --> 17:08.944
about a british chick
who made contact with you.


17:08.978 --> 17:10.302
And so?


17:10.408 --> 17:11.784
You know where she is?


17:11.817 --> 17:13.173
- Yeah.
- Great.


17:13.210 --> 17:14.253
Could you tell me
where I could find her?


17:14.308 --> 17:15.315
No.


17:15.407 --> 17:16.672
Course not.


17:16.707 --> 17:18.012
Look, Rufus, man...


17:20.607 --> 17:22.293
Look,
let me point something out to you.


17:22.308 --> 17:25.033
You are knocking at my door,
so don't "Look, man" me.


17:25.078 --> 17:26.212
I'm not your man.


17:27.210 --> 17:28.715
I'm sorry, sir.


17:29.609 --> 17:31.173
All right, let me tell you a little story.


17:31.220 --> 17:32.612
See, once upon a time, Bobby called me,


17:32.710 --> 17:35.213
asked me to call him
if I got a whiff of this Bela Talbot.


17:35.248 --> 17:38.242
I got a whiff. I called. The end.


17:38.277 --> 17:40.073
Okay, yeah, if you could just
tell me where she is, I mean,


17:40.107 --> 17:41.505
that would be great.


17:42.108 --> 17:44.385
- Dean Winchester, right?
- Yeah.


17:44.407 --> 17:47.172
Dean, do I look like I'm here
to help you?


17:47.707 --> 17:49.254
I'm gonna say no.


17:49.299 --> 17:51.173
Then get the hell of my property.


17:51.268 --> 17:52.694
All right, fair enough.


17:52.739 --> 17:54.743
I got one more question for you,
though.


17:55.210 --> 17:56.903
See, I got this, uh


17:56.907 --> 17:59.405
this bottle of scotch, and... uh,


18:00.177 --> 18:01.704
is this considered good?


18:07.639 --> 18:09.053
Bottoms up.


18:12.548 --> 18:15.185
You know,
I don't even bother drinking


18:15.229 --> 18:16.825
unless it's this stuff.


18:18.210 --> 18:20.662
Nectar of the gods, I'm telling you.


18:20.707 --> 18:22.305
Hey, it's a nice change, you know.


18:22.357 --> 18:24.515
Most of my whiskey's from a plastic jug.


18:26.810 --> 18:30.433
So, Bela was here because...


18:30.469 --> 18:32.543
She wanted to buy a couple of things,


18:33.309 --> 18:35.803
which is gonna take me some time
to round up.


18:35.907 --> 18:37.352
Where is she now?


18:39.508 --> 18:41.364
Can I ask you something?


18:42.108 --> 18:43.304
Sure.


18:43.709 --> 18:45.675
You got three weeks left.


18:45.710 --> 18:47.172
Why are you wasting your time


18:47.208 --> 18:50.673
chasing after that
skinny, stuck-up english girl?


18:54.109 --> 18:55.554
How do you know about that?


18:59.508 --> 19:01.744
Because I know things.


19:03.707 --> 19:06.972
I know a lot of things
about a lot of people.


19:08.210 --> 19:09.795
Is that so?


19:09.807 --> 19:12.623
I know ain't no peashooter
gonna save you.


19:15.707 --> 19:17.572
What makes you so sure?


19:18.810 --> 19:21.052
'Cause that's the job, kid.


19:21.709 --> 19:23.955
Even if you manage
to scrape out of this one,


19:24.049 --> 19:26.753
there'just gonna be something else
down the road.


19:27.907 --> 19:29.504
Folks like us...


19:30.209 --> 19:32.355
there ain't no happy ending.


19:33.479 --> 19:35.172
We all know it coming.


19:39.610 --> 19:41.812
Well, ain't you a bucket of sunshine?


19:46.907 --> 19:50.113
I'm what you've got
to look forward to if you survive.


19:53.708 --> 19:55.224
But you won't.


20:39.709 --> 20:41.072
So, Bela...


20:42.277 --> 20:44.083
Hotel Canaan.


20:44.608 --> 20:46.525
Room 39.


20:48.509 --> 20:50.483
But watch your back.


20:50.708 --> 20:52.444
I think I can handle Bela.


20:52.490 --> 20:54.762
Oh, don't be so sure about that.


20:54.808 --> 20:57.594
There are things
that you don't know about her.


20:58.209 --> 20:59.742
Oh, and you do?


20:59.807 --> 21:00.892
Right.


21:01.647 --> 21:03.244
Because you know things.


21:03.508 --> 21:04.424
Yep.


21:04.509 --> 21:06.695
And let me guess...
you lift her fingerprint?


21:06.710 --> 21:07.994
Yep.


21:08.620 --> 21:10.213
And that got you jack.


21:10.309 --> 21:11.535
Yep.


21:13.107 --> 21:14.604
She burnt them off.


21:16.009 --> 21:17.875
Probably years ago.


21:18.408 --> 21:20.185
Yeah, so you're right where we are.


21:20.220 --> 21:21.343
Nope.


21:25.707 --> 21:27.235
You do her ear?


21:28.109 --> 21:29.242
Sorry?


21:29.310 --> 21:31.165
You do her ear?


21:34.209 --> 21:36.432
Hey, man, I'll try anything once,
but I don't know.


21:36.480 --> 21:37.995
That sounds uncomfortable.


21:39.708 --> 21:43.252
Ears are as unique to humans
as fingerprints.


21:44.109 --> 21:45.255
- No kidding.
- Of course,


21:45.298 --> 21:47.725
that don't fly in the
courts over here,


21:48.470 --> 21:51.915
but in England, they're all over it.


21:54.709 --> 21:56.564
A friend of a friend...


21:57.099 --> 21:58.472
of a friend


21:58.507 --> 22:01.354
faxed me 10 pages
of confidential files


22:01.409 --> 22:03.042
within a day.


22:03.789 --> 22:08.243
All I had to send him was
one clean shot off the security camera.


22:09.507 --> 22:10.714
Right.


22:11.708 --> 22:13.642
One clean shot of her ear.


22:29.890 --> 22:32.543
The so-called Bela Talbot.


24:56.950 --> 24:58.320
Shh! Shh! Shh!


24:58.370 --> 24:59.835
It's okay. I'm here to help you.


24:59.849 --> 25:01.417
I'm here to help you.
I'm gonna help you.


25:11.471 --> 25:14.684
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay, here we go.


26:17.300 --> 26:19.100
Ok, watch your head.


26:20.897 --> 26:21.764
Sorry.


26:31.448 --> 26:33.542
Try to get straight. Try to get straight.


27:19.898 --> 27:21.775
- Where's the colt?
- Dean.


27:21.807 --> 27:23.474
No extra words.


27:23.898 --> 27:27.223
It's long gone,
across the world by now.


27:28.699 --> 27:29.783
You're lying.


27:29.848 --> 27:31.854
I'll call the buyer. Speak farsi?


27:33.399 --> 27:34.632
What the hell...


27:34.687 --> 27:36.353
Don't flatter yourself.


27:38.900 --> 27:41.462
- Don't move.
- I told you I don't have it.


27:41.498 --> 27:43.944
Oh, yeah, I'm definitely
gonna take your word for it.


27:53.397 --> 27:54.835
Don't move.


28:05.980 --> 28:07.033
It's gone.


28:08.398 --> 28:10.275
Get on a plane if you must.


28:13.397 --> 28:16.143
Track down the buyer.
You might catch up to him eventually.


28:21.898 --> 28:23.364
Are you going to kill me?


28:23.398 --> 28:24.963
Oh, yeah.


28:26.300 --> 28:28.025
You're not the cold-blooded type.


28:28.098 --> 28:29.493
You mean like you?


28:29.497 --> 28:31.185
That's true.


28:31.200 --> 28:34.102
See, I couldn't imagine
killing my parents.


28:35.900 --> 28:37.972
- I don't know what you're talking...
- Yes, you do.


28:39.397 --> 28:41.375
You were, what, 14?


28:41.897 --> 28:44.285
Folks died in some shady car accident.


28:44.327 --> 28:46.172
Police suspected a slashed brake line,


28:46.198 --> 28:48.664
but it was all too crispy to tell.


28:48.699 --> 28:50.432
Cut to little Bela...


28:50.477 --> 28:52.824
Oh, I'm sorry, Abby...


28:52.898 --> 28:54.863
inheriting millions.


28:55.398 --> 28:57.465
- How did you ev...
- Doesn't matter.


29:22.818 --> 29:24.504
They were lovely people.


29:25.199 --> 29:26.893
And I killed them.


29:28.398 --> 29:29.824
And I got rich.


29:29.858 --> 29:32.324
I can't be bothered to give a damn.


29:34.200 --> 29:36.782
Just like I don't care
what happens to you.


29:44.897 --> 29:46.773
You make me sick.


29:48.798 --> 29:50.554
Likewise.


30:15.899 --> 30:17.475
You're not worth it.


30:47.400 --> 30:48.754
It worked.


30:49.199 --> 30:50.563
He found me.


30:51.898 --> 30:53.725
No, Sam wasn't with him.


30:54.900 --> 30:56.304
But I know where they are.


31:02.398 --> 31:04.092
- Dean?
- Yeah.


31:04.199 --> 31:06.313
- Did you get the colt?
- What do you think?


31:06.347 --> 31:07.813
So, does that mean Bela is...


31:07.847 --> 31:10.395
No, no, she deserves to die
a dozen times over,


31:10.430 --> 31:11.613
but I couldn't do it.


31:11.699 --> 31:13.212
I'm really screwed, Sammy.


31:13.257 --> 31:14.923
- No, you're just...
- But you were right.


31:14.958 --> 31:16.782
Bela was a goose chase.


31:18.198 --> 31:19.483
The colt's gone,


31:19.488 --> 31:22.055
and this time I'm really screwed, Sam.


31:22.098 --> 31:23.312
Maybe not.


31:23.897 --> 31:25.875
Look, I found Benton's cabin.


31:25.900 --> 31:27.855
- You okay? Was he there?
- Yeah.


31:27.898 --> 31:29.105
- Did you kill him?
- No.


31:29.149 --> 31:31.264
- What do you mean, "no"?
- Dean, please just listen for a second.


31:31.298 --> 31:33.993
I found his lab book,
and it has the formula.


31:34.038 --> 31:36.264
- What, the live-forever formula?


31:36.338 --> 31:37.345
Great, let me guess.


31:37.388 --> 31:38.983
I got to drink blood
out of a baby's skull?


31:38.999 --> 31:42.172
No, that's the thing.
It's not black magic.


31:42.200 --> 31:44.732
There's no blood sacrifice or anything.


31:45.797 --> 31:47.504
It's just science, Dean.


31:47.598 --> 31:50.752
Very, very extremely weird science, but...


31:50.797 --> 31:52.503
Wait, wait, wait. What are...
What are you saying? You think...


31:52.547 --> 31:54.264
Dean, I think it might be doable.


31:54.320 --> 31:55.852
I mean,
I know we've hit a lot of walls, but I...


31:55.900 --> 31:58.504
I think this formula,
I think it might be it.


31:58.869 --> 32:00.262
This could save you.


32:00.779 --> 32:02.335
Okay, so, this formula...


32:02.398 --> 32:04.544
Well, I mean, look, look,
we're not in the clear yet.


32:04.597 --> 32:06.083
There are still things that I don't get.


32:07.897 --> 32:08.714
Sam?


32:12.897 --> 32:14.195
Sammy!


32:24.929 --> 32:27.082
You can relax.


32:27.399 --> 32:29.632
It's all gonna be okay.


32:29.698 --> 32:31.474
Ain't nothing gonna happen here


32:31.499 --> 32:33.742
that you got to worry about, Sammy.


32:33.820 --> 32:37.692
Your chances of coming out
of this procedure alive?


32:37.798 --> 32:39.933
Very, very high.


32:40.039 --> 32:41.612
How do you know my name?


32:42.797 --> 32:43.863
Oh...


32:45.898 --> 32:47.265
I know.


32:49.199 --> 32:52.413
You think I'm some kind of monster,
don't you?


32:52.599 --> 32:56.653
Well, I got to tell you,
I have never done one thing


32:56.699 --> 32:59.113
that I did not have to do.


32:59.158 --> 33:04.283
This whole eternal-life thing
is very high-maintenance.


33:05.939 --> 33:09.712
If something goes bad,
like my eyes here...


33:10.799 --> 33:12.972
you got to replace them.


33:17.797 --> 33:19.802
And sometimes things get damaged,


33:19.847 --> 33:24.605
like when your father cut out my heart.
Now, that...


33:24.700 --> 33:28.542
That was very inconvenient.


33:31.197 --> 33:34.383
So,
I'm sure that you can understand


33:34.399 --> 33:37.223
all the joy I felt


33:37.257 --> 33:41.944
when I read all
about myself here in his journal.


33:47.947 --> 33:50.332
Kind of makes this whole thing


33:51.400 --> 33:56.463
just feel like some
kind of family reunion, don't it?


33:57.797 --> 34:00.523
Well, I guess it's about time


34:00.897 --> 34:03.713
that we get this thing started.


34:20.298 --> 34:22.654
Shoot all you want.


34:42.299 --> 34:43.873
A knife?


34:46.399 --> 34:51.844
What part of immortality
do you not understand?


34:54.897 --> 34:57.823
Pity about the heart, though.


34:57.998 --> 35:01.212
It was a brand-new one.


35:01.300 --> 35:02.573
Good.


35:02.978 --> 35:05.273
It should be pumping nice and strong...


35:06.400 --> 35:10.435
Sending this stuff throughout
your whole body.


35:11.398 --> 35:12.874
See, I picked up your little


35:12.919 --> 35:15.472
bottle upstairs and dipped the knife in it.


35:29.870 --> 35:31.974
Oh, hiya, doc.


35:32.899 --> 35:35.152
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bac-y.


35:37.197 --> 35:39.262
- Please.
- Please what?


35:39.277 --> 35:41.424
You've been killing poor bastards
for over 150 years


35:41.467 --> 35:43.295
and now you got a request?
Shut up.


35:43.330 --> 35:46.062
No, you don't understand.
I can help you. I know


35:46.100 --> 35:47.282
what you need.


35:47.320 --> 35:48.983
We might have to cut him up
into little bits. You know,


35:49.018 --> 35:50.905
this immortality thing is a bitch.


35:50.940 --> 35:54.234
I can read the formula for you.


35:54.900 --> 35:58.183
The whole immortality...


35:58.198 --> 36:02.083
Forever young, never die.


36:22.210 --> 36:23.700
What?


36:26.201 --> 36:27.793
I mean,
we're talking hell in three weeks.


36:27.830 --> 36:30.025
Or needing a new pancreas
in like half a century.


36:30.029 --> 36:31.803
Yeah, well, you can't exactly get those
at a kwik-e-mart.


36:31.841 --> 36:34.424
It's not perfect, but it buys us more time
to think of something better.


36:34.498 --> 36:36.854
We just need time, Dean.
I mean, please, just...


36:37.358 --> 36:38.974
just think about it.


36:42.598 --> 36:43.685
No.


36:44.200 --> 36:46.504
- Dean, don't you want to live?
- What he is isn't living.


36:46.548 --> 36:47.913
- Look, this is simple.
- Simple?


36:47.951 --> 36:51.173
To me it is, okay.
Black or white; human, not human.


36:52.700 --> 36:54.354
See, what the doc is


36:54.361 --> 36:56.255
is a freakin' monster.


36:56.299 --> 36:57.784
I can't do it.


36:58.300 --> 37:00.134
I would rather go to hell.


37:00.679 --> 37:04.033
You don't understand.
I can help you!


37:07.431 --> 37:09.234
Now, I'm gonna take care of him.


37:09.699 --> 37:11.763
You can help me or not.
It's up to you.


37:42.711 --> 37:44.064
No! No!


37:44.139 --> 37:45.886
Don't! Stop it!


37:45.931 --> 37:48.394
I can help you! No!


37:48.440 --> 37:50.253
Enjoy forever in there, doc.


37:52.078 --> 37:53.466
Let me out!


37:58.168 --> 38:00.656
I can save you!


38:00.698 --> 38:02.566
No. Don't.


39:16.091 --> 39:17.263
Hiya, Bela.


39:17.308 --> 39:19.404
Here's a fun fact you may not know...


39:19.439 --> 39:21.176
I felt your hand in my pocket


39:21.191 --> 39:22.846
when you swiped that motel receipt.


39:22.879 --> 39:23.853
You don't understand.


39:23.899 --> 39:26.244
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I understand perfectly.


39:26.301 --> 39:28.733
You see, I noticed something interesting
in your hotel room,


39:28.798 --> 39:32.093
something tucked above the door.
An herb...


39:32.140 --> 39:33.893
devil's shoestring.


39:34.398 --> 39:36.423
Well, there's only one use for that...


39:36.798 --> 39:38.836
holding hellhounds at bay.


39:39.200 --> 39:40.293
So, you know what I did?
I went back,


39:40.299 --> 39:42.245
and I took another look at
your folks' obit.


39:42.291 --> 39:45.044
Turns out they died 10 years ago today.


39:45.698 --> 39:47.213
You didn't kill them.


39:47.559 --> 39:49.616
A demon did your dirty work.


39:49.649 --> 39:52.495
You made a deal, didn't you, Bela?


39:52.651 --> 39:54.474
And it's come due.


40:00.721 --> 40:02.573
I can take care of them for you.


40:05.099 --> 40:07.025
And it won't even cost you anything.


40:09.201 --> 40:12.674
For 10 whole years.


40:18.200 --> 40:20.854
Is that why you stole the colt, huh?


40:21.201 --> 40:22.753
To try to wiggle out of your deal?


40:22.798 --> 40:25.374
- Our gun for your soul?
- Yes.


40:25.411 --> 40:27.764
But stealing the colt
wasn't quite enough, I'm guessing.


40:27.850 --> 40:29.524
They changed the deal.


40:30.701 --> 40:32.465
They wanted me to kill Sam.


40:32.500 --> 40:34.234
Really? Wow.


40:34.300 --> 40:35.955
Demons untrustworthy...


40:36.200 --> 40:37.396
Shocker.


40:38.099 --> 40:40.005
That's kind of a tight deadline, too.


40:40.080 --> 40:41.534
What time is it?


40:41.599 --> 40:44.834
Oh, look at that. Almost midnight.


40:45.198 --> 40:47.135
Dean, listen, I need help.


40:47.199 --> 40:49.136
Sweetheart, we are weeks past help.


40:49.181 --> 40:50.785
I know I don't deserve it.


40:50.819 --> 40:51.863
You know what? You're right.
You don't.


40:51.899 --> 40:53.653
But you know
what the bitch of the bunch is?


40:53.699 --> 40:56.763
If you would have just come to us sooner
and asked for help,


40:56.800 --> 40:59.014
we probably could have taken the colt
and saved you.


40:59.300 --> 41:01.516
I know, and saved yourself.


41:02.201 --> 41:04.093
I know about your deal, Dean.


41:04.178 --> 41:05.465
Wnd who told you that?


41:05.501 --> 41:07.166
The demon that holds it.


41:07.198 --> 41:08.705
She holds mine, too.


41:09.199 --> 41:11.714
- She says she holds every deal.
- She?


41:11.800 --> 41:12.973
Her name's Lilith.


41:13.699 --> 41:14.834
Lilith?


41:16.700 --> 41:18.114
Why should I believe you?


41:18.929 --> 41:21.143
You shouldn't, but it's the truth.


41:21.180 --> 41:22.733
This can't help you, Bela.


41:23.209 --> 41:25.255
Not now.
Why are you telling me this?


41:25.699 --> 41:28.615
Because just maybe you can kill the bitch.


41:32.701 --> 41:34.454
I'll see you in hell.
