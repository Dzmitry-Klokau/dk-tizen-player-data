00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.880
I got a year to live, sam.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.110
I'd like to make the most of it.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.530
So what do you say we kill some evil sons
of bitches and we raise a little hell?

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.480
THEN

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.980
You didn't tell dean? Tell me what?

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.310
There's a big new up-and-comer.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.180
Her name is lilith.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.500
She really, really wants sam's
intestines on a stick.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.340
Let dean out of his deal right now.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.490
I'm just a saleswoman.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.950
I got a boss like everybody.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.200
Who holds the contract?

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.640
I can't tell you.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.130
Bela talbot's her real name.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.130
The colt.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.520
Bela stole the colt.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.590
I want it back, bela.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.070
Your little pistol, you mean?

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.780
Sorry.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.230
You understand how many people
are gonna die if you do this?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.550
What exactly is it that you think
I plan to do with it?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.680
Take the only weapon we have against an army
of demons and sell it to the highest bidder.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.080
You know nothing about me.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.250
- Pack your crap.
- Why?

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.260
Where are we going?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.470
We're gonna go hunt the bitch down.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.500
I don't want to go to hell.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.650
We'll find a way to save you.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.980
I'm scared, sam.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.250
I'm really scared.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.090
And the only person that can get
me out of this thing is me.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.690
And me.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.540
NOW

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.505
Up for a drink?

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.946
No, I can't.
I got to be up at the cracky down.

00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:09.108
Duty calls.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.569
- Boob job?
- I wish.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:14.249
Nah, some crabby old broad
wants the works.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.073
I need a forklift to get it all back up.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.000
All that work to have what?
15 minutes off her faces?

00:01:19.035 --> 00:01:20.856
Staying young is a brutal business.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.095
Hey!

00:02:00.408 --> 00:02:01.440
Help!

00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:07.454
Let me out of here!

00:02:08.146 --> 00:02:09.763
Help!

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.405
- Sir?
- Please.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.632
It's okay, sir.
Let me see what happened.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:30.971
Don't you worry.
There's nothing I haven't seen.

00:02:31.508 --> 00:02:33.791
- No, no, no...
- Let me see...

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.800
Transcript : www.1000fr.com
Synchro : Flolo

00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:52.061
Stop!

00:02:52.508 --> 00:02:53.902
You ready to talk?

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:57.370
I don't know.

00:02:57.708 --> 00:02:59.403
I don't know anything!

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.483
Oh, you hear that, Sam?
He doesn't know anything.

00:03:01.507 --> 00:03:02.783
Yeah, I heard.

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:04.110
I'm telling you the truth.

00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:05.201
Oh, you are?

00:03:05.306 --> 00:03:07.481
My god,
then I owe you an apology.

00:03:07.507 --> 00:03:09.171
Allow me to make it up to you.

00:03:17.308 --> 00:03:19.401
I'm gonna ask you one last time...

00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:21.691
Who holds my contract?!

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:35.203
Your mother.

00:03:37.108 --> 00:03:40.193
Yeah, she, uh, showed it to me
right before I bent her over.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:46.451
I want a name.

00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:48.581
- Or else...
- Or what?

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:52.710
You're gonna squirt
your holy water in both ends?

00:03:53.206 --> 00:03:54.721
Please.

00:03:54.805 --> 00:03:57.511
Brother, that's like a fleabite
compared to what's coming to me

00:03:57.557 --> 00:03:59.231
if I tell you jack.

00:04:01.906 --> 00:04:03.272
Do what you want.

00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:07.402
The only thing I'm scared
is the demon holding your ticket.

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:23.591
How does that feel?
Does that feel good?

00:04:25.906 --> 00:04:27.200
Go ahead.

00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:30.352
Send me back to hell...

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:33.583
'Cause when you get there,
I'll be waiting for you...

00:04:34.508 --> 00:04:36.033
With a few pals who are dying

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:38.961
for a nice little meet and greet
Dean Winchester.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.541
Should I?

00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:45.791
Send him someplace
he can't hurt anyone else.

00:04:59.008 --> 00:05:00.753
You ran the prints twice?

00:05:00.805 --> 00:05:02.040
Are you sure?

00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:07.170
Okay. Yeah,
just chalk it up to lab error.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.901
Don't I know it. Okay.

00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:11.920
Thanks.
Yeah, I'll tell the lieutenant.

00:05:12.507 --> 00:05:13.701
Bury the body?

00:05:14.006 --> 00:05:15.530
Yeah.

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:18.391
Looks like these demons
ride 'em hard just for kicks.

00:05:22.308 --> 00:05:23.753
What was the phone call about?

00:05:23.805 --> 00:05:25.562
Remember that thing in the paper yesterday?

00:05:25.607 --> 00:05:27.902
"Stripper suffocates dude with thighs"?

00:05:27.947 --> 00:05:29.072
The other thing.

00:05:29.106 --> 00:05:31.062
Right,
the guy that walks into the E.R.

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:32.952
and kneels over dead.
His stomach's ripped out?

00:05:33.075 --> 00:05:35.063
His liver, actually.
Anyways, I just found out

00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:37.130
- something pretty damn interesting.
- What?

00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:40.372
The dead body covered
in bloody fingerprints, not the victim's.

00:05:41.406 --> 00:05:44.041
Okay, great. My man Dave Caruso
will be stoked to hear it.

00:05:44.086 --> 00:05:48.190
Those fingerprints match a guy
who died in 1981.

00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:50.003
Really?

00:05:50.986 --> 00:05:52.702
So, what are we talking?

00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:54.932
Uh, walking dead? Walking, killing dead?

00:05:55.008 --> 00:05:56.080
Maybe.

00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:59.011
Zombies do like the other other white meat.

00:06:02.306 --> 00:06:04.200
Speaking of,
what do you care about zombies?

00:06:04.306 --> 00:06:05.190
What do you mean?

00:06:05.218 --> 00:06:07.001
Well, you've been on soul-saving detail
for months now.

00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:08.941
And we're three weeks out,
and all of a sudden,

00:06:08.987 --> 00:06:10.680
you're interested
in some hot zombie action?

00:06:10.707 --> 00:06:12.883
Hey, man, you're the one
who's been all gung ho to hunt.

00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:15.013
- I just thought I'd be doing you a favor.
- Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

00:06:15.105 --> 00:06:17.851
I didn't say I didn't want to do it, okay.
I mean obviously

00:06:17.895 --> 00:06:21.591
- I want to hunt some zombies.
- Okay, fine, whatever.

00:06:27.808 --> 00:06:30.512
Yeah, the rest of the body was intact.

00:06:30.546 --> 00:06:32.672
The liver was the only organ missing.

00:06:33.207 --> 00:06:34.680
Now, where the liver was ripped out,

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:37.210
did you happen to notice any teeth marks?

00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:39.741
Can I see your badges?

00:06:39.805 --> 00:06:41.053
Of course, sure.

00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:48.310
- Fine. So you're cops and morons.
- Excuse me?

00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:51.661
- No, no. We're very smart.
- The liver was not ripped out.

00:06:58.707 --> 00:07:00.400
It was removed.

00:07:00.408 --> 00:07:02.201
Surgically.

00:07:02.308 --> 00:07:04.800
By someone who knew
their way around a scalpel.

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:08.941
Didn't you read my report?

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:11.992
Of course we did. Oh, it was riveting.

00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:14.331
It was a real page-turner, just delightful.

00:07:15.506 --> 00:07:17.092
- You done?
- I think so.

00:07:17.117 --> 00:07:18.711
Please go away.

00:07:18.756 --> 00:07:19.941
Sure.

00:07:25.508 --> 00:07:26.571
What?

00:07:27.175 --> 00:07:28.050
Nothing.

00:07:28.107 --> 00:07:30.391
So, that kind of punches a hole
in our zombie theory, huh,

00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:31.462
that scalpel thing?

00:07:31.506 --> 00:07:34.460
Yeah, zombie with skills,
"Dr. Quinn, medicine zombie".

00:07:35.306 --> 00:07:36.581
Maybe we're on the wrong track, Dean,

00:07:36.616 --> 00:07:38.131
looking for hacked-up corpses.

00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:39.833
What should we be looking for?

00:07:39.908 --> 00:07:41.301
Survivors.

00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:43.643
This isn't zombie lunch.
This is organ theft.

00:07:44.907 --> 00:07:47.363
I told the cops all of this yesterday.

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:49.103
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:50.850
It's just a couple of questions, sir.

00:07:50.897 --> 00:07:52.093
Hey, man.

00:07:52.507 --> 00:07:54.681
I just got my kidney stolen.

00:07:55.506 --> 00:07:56.823
I'm tired.

00:07:56.906 --> 00:07:59.270
We'll be out of here quick.
Don't you want to get the guy?

00:07:59.306 --> 00:08:01.350
Will it get me back my kidney?

00:08:02.906 --> 00:08:04.932
So what's the last thing you remember?

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:06.461
Feeding my meter.

00:08:08.057 --> 00:08:09.840
He jumped from behind...

00:08:09.877 --> 00:08:13.091
and then I wake up strapped to a table.

00:08:13.107 --> 00:08:18.352
And then the worst pain
you could possibly imagine, only worse.

00:08:19.007 --> 00:08:21.970
And then I black out again.
Thank god.

00:08:22.007 --> 00:08:24.231
And then I wake up screaming

00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:26.523
in some no-tell motel

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:29.202
in a bathtub full of ice.

00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:31.203
Do you remember anything
about the surgery know,

00:08:31.227 --> 00:08:34.032
what the guy looked like,
any details about the room?

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.472
Let me think about that.

00:08:36.508 --> 00:08:37.821
Yeah...

00:08:38.506 --> 00:08:42.022
One thing is coming back to me.
You know what I remember?

00:08:42.108 --> 00:08:44.573
Getting my kidney cut out of my body!

00:08:51.105 --> 00:08:53.082
- So, I got a theory.
- Yeah?

00:08:53.107 --> 00:08:54.842
Yeah, I talked to Mr. Giggle's doctor.

00:08:54.878 --> 00:08:57.332
Turns out his incisions
were sewn up with silk.

00:08:57.607 --> 00:08:59.662
- That's weird.
- Yeah, nowadays it is,

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:01.762
but silk used to be the suture of choice

00:09:01.795 --> 00:09:04.600
back in the early 19th century.
It was really problematic.

00:09:04.638 --> 00:09:06.350
Patients would get massive infections.

00:09:06.406 --> 00:09:08.423
The death rate was insane.

00:09:08.505 --> 00:09:09.652
- Good times.
- Right,

00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:11.590
so doctors,
they had to do whatever they could

00:09:11.628 --> 00:09:13.100
to keep infections from spreading.

00:09:13.203 --> 00:09:15.444
- One way was maggots.
- Dude, I'm eating.

00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:17.903
It actually kind of worked
because maggots, they eat bad tissue,

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.735
and they leave good tissue.
And get this. When they found our guy,

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:24.313
- his body cavity was stuffed full of maggots.
- Dude, I'm eating.

00:09:24.346 --> 00:09:25.913
Alright let me get this straight.

00:09:27.006 --> 00:09:29.002
- So, people are getting ganked, right?
- Yeah.

00:09:29.048 --> 00:09:31.672
A little "antiques roadshow" surgery,
some organ theft.

00:09:31.718 --> 00:09:34.133
- But why does that sound familiar?
- Because you heard it before.

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:36.810
When you we a kid... from dad.

00:09:39.008 --> 00:09:40.521
Doc Benton...

00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:42.833
real-life doctor, lived in New Hampshire,

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:45.042
brilliant and obsessed with alchemy,

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:47.701
especially how to live forever.

00:09:47.806 --> 00:09:50.491
So, in 1816,
doc abandons his practice and...

00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:52.861
Right, yeah, nobody hears from him
for like 20 years,

00:09:52.906 --> 00:09:54.483
and all of sudden,
people start showing up dead.

00:09:54.568 --> 00:09:57.890
Dead or missing an organ
or the hand or some other kind of part.

00:09:57.908 --> 00:09:59.870
'Cause whatever he was doing
was actually working.

00:09:59.906 --> 00:10:02.691
He just kept on ticking.
Parts would wear out, he'd replace them.

00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:04.920
But I thought dad hunted him down
and took his heart out.

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:07.832
Yeah, I guess doc
must have plugged in a new one.

00:10:09.306 --> 00:10:10.961
All right, where's he doing the deed?

00:10:11.006 --> 00:10:13.800
According to this, Ben's picky
about where he sets up his lab.

00:10:13.908 --> 00:10:17.092
He likes dense forest
with access to a river or stream

00:10:17.106 --> 00:10:18.710
- or some kind of freshwater.
- Why?

00:10:18.808 --> 00:10:22.183
Because that's where he likes
to dump the bile

00:10:22.228 --> 00:10:24.972
and intestines and fecal matter.

00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:27.442
Lost your appetite yet?

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.013
Maybe I can stay mad at you.

00:12:05.916 --> 00:12:07.770
No please.

00:12:09.637 --> 00:12:10.892
No.

00:12:20.456 --> 00:12:22.992
No, no.

00:12:46.068 --> 00:12:48.042
So these are all the cabins.

00:12:48.127 --> 00:12:49.791
They most have been abandonned
for years.

00:12:49.826 --> 00:12:51.291
So what the hell
are we waiting for?

00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:03.490
They got finally got a bate on Bella.

00:13:03.537 --> 00:13:04.722
I'm listenning.

00:13:04.727 --> 00:13:06.153
Rufus Turner.

00:13:06.188 --> 00:13:07.873
Who's that? Like a Cleveland steamer?

00:13:07.916 --> 00:13:10.182
He's a hunter,
or he used to be.

00:13:10.225 --> 00:13:11.222
And now?

00:13:11.256 --> 00:13:13.672
Permit mostly.
Doesn't want selling on the side.

00:13:13.718 --> 00:13:14.621
Anyway.

00:13:14.678 --> 00:13:17.013
I put the word out on Bella
months ago.

00:13:17.018 --> 00:13:19.880
He just called.
Said a woman got in touch,

00:13:19.915 --> 00:13:21.401
wanted to buy some things.

00:13:21.438 --> 00:13:22.762
And he thinks it's Bella?

00:13:22.828 --> 00:13:25.350
British accent, went by the name
Mina Chandler.

00:13:25.396 --> 00:13:26.670
She's used that before.

00:13:27.357 --> 00:13:28.740
Well, it's kinda of a sloppy move

00:13:28.788 --> 00:13:30.770
in getting in contact
with one of your old friends.

00:13:30.807 --> 00:13:33.842
A friend? ???
in fifteen years.

00:13:33.878 --> 00:13:36.073
He's not the christmas card type.

00:13:36.105 --> 00:13:38.213
I doubt she knows I know him.

00:13:38.525 --> 00:13:40.230
Canaan, Vermont.

00:13:40.238 --> 00:13:42.832
- Thanks, Bobby. We're on our way.
- One other thing.

00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:45.152
Take a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.

00:13:45.155 --> 00:13:46.412
Okay.

00:13:47.547 --> 00:13:49.223
- Come on. We're going after Bella.
- What?

00:13:49.265 --> 00:13:51.983
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.
- Come on. Would you stop? The clock's ticking.

00:13:52.018 --> 00:13:54.493
Look, I think we should stay here
and finish the cakes.

00:13:54.537 --> 00:13:56.991
- You're insane?
- Dean, there's no way she still has the colt!

00:13:56.998 --> 00:13:59.653
There was months ago! She probably
sold it the second she got it.

00:13:59.908 --> 00:14:01.791
Well, then I'll kill her.
Win-win.

00:14:02.827 --> 00:14:03.973
We're going!

00:14:04.736 --> 00:14:06.283
- No.
- Why the hell not?

00:14:06.328 --> 00:14:08.572
Dean, this is here. Now.

00:14:08.617 --> 00:14:10.403
This is what's gonna save you.

00:14:10.447 --> 00:14:12.302
What? Chasing some Frankenstein?

00:14:12.307 --> 00:14:13.922
Chasing immortality.

00:14:16.448 --> 00:14:18.071
Look, Benton can't die.

00:14:18.105 --> 00:14:20.350
We find out how he did,
we can do it to you.

00:14:20.396 --> 00:14:22.912
- What are you talking about?
- You have to die before you go to hell, right?

00:14:23.006 --> 00:14:25.850
- So, if you can never die, then...
- Wait, wait, wait. What are you saying?

00:14:28.528 --> 00:14:30.881
Did you know that this was ???
from the jump?

00:14:31.748 --> 00:14:32.933
No.

00:14:34.855 --> 00:14:37.341
- Look, I was hoping.
- So the whole zombie thing,

00:14:37.358 --> 00:14:38.751
- it was lying to me?
- I don't wanna say anything

00:14:38.758 --> 00:14:40.332
until we're sure, Dean.
All I'm trying to do

00:14:40.378 --> 00:14:41.501
is find an answer here.

00:14:41.537 --> 00:14:43.442
No. What you're trying to do is chase

00:14:43.477 --> 00:14:46.172
slicy here.
And to kill him?

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:48.860
No. You wanna buy him
a freaking beer. You wanna study him.

00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:50.700
- I was just trying to help.
- You're not helping!

00:14:50.716 --> 00:14:52.782
You forget that if I ???
on this deal,

00:14:52.785 --> 00:14:53.973
you die.

00:14:53.975 --> 00:14:55.612
Guess what?
Living forever is well...

00:14:55.616 --> 00:14:57.901
Fine! Then, whatever the magic pill is,
I'll take it too!

00:14:57.905 --> 00:15:01.081
Oh, what is it? Sid and Nancy?
No. It's just like Bobby was saying.

00:15:01.088 --> 00:15:02.700
We kill the demon who owns the contract,

00:15:02.708 --> 00:15:05.270
and this whole damn thing gets clean.
That's our best shot.

00:15:05.286 --> 00:15:07.231
Even if you had the colt, Dean,
who you're gonna shoot?

00:15:07.238 --> 00:15:08.850
We've no idea
who holds the ticket.

00:15:08.856 --> 00:15:11.220
I'll shoot the whole hellhouse
before they slash me up.

00:15:11.236 --> 00:15:13.430
- Now, you're coming or not?
- I'm staying here.

00:15:15.187 --> 00:15:16.470
No, you're not.

00:15:16.475 --> 00:15:18.982
'Cause I'm not gonna let you
wander out in the woods alone

00:15:18.986 --> 00:15:21.463
to track some older stealing freak.

00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:23.431
- Look, let me...
- No, I'm not gonna let you.

00:15:23.435 --> 00:15:24.843
How are you gonna stop me?

00:15:26.705 --> 00:15:28.343
Look, man,

00:15:28.347 --> 00:15:30.471
we're trying to do the same thing here.

00:15:34.065 --> 00:15:35.370
I know.

00:15:40.197 --> 00:15:41.693
But I'm going.

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.690
So if you wanna stay...

00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:46.493
stay.

00:16:03.898 --> 00:16:05.343
Sammy, be careful.

00:16:09.538 --> 00:16:10.470
You too.

00:16:42.087 --> 00:16:43.480
What?

00:16:43.488 --> 00:16:46.130
Hi, uh, Rufus?

00:16:46.135 --> 00:16:47.312
Yeah, even if I am,

00:16:47.327 --> 00:16:49.621
the question is still the same.
What?

00:16:50.755 --> 00:16:53.352
Uh, I'm Dean Winchester.
I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's.

00:16:53.398 --> 00:16:54.400
So?

00:16:54.906 --> 00:16:56.403
You called him this morning.

00:16:56.508 --> 00:16:57.522
So?

00:16:59.608 --> 00:17:01.822
Uh, you told Bobby

00:17:01.908 --> 00:17:03.742
about a british chick
who made contact with you.

00:17:03.776 --> 00:17:05.100
And so?

00:17:05.206 --> 00:17:06.582
You know where she is?

00:17:06.615 --> 00:17:07.971
- Yeah.
- Great.

00:17:08.008 --> 00:17:09.051
Could you tell me
where I could find her?

00:17:09.106 --> 00:17:10.113
No.

00:17:10.205 --> 00:17:11.470
Course not.

00:17:11.505 --> 00:17:12.810
Look, Rufus, man...

00:17:15.405 --> 00:17:17.091
Look,
let me point something out to you.

00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:19.831
You are knocking at my door,
so don't "Look, man" me.

00:17:19.876 --> 00:17:21.010
I'm not your man.

00:17:22.008 --> 00:17:23.513
I'm sorry, sir.

00:17:24.407 --> 00:17:25.971
All right, let me tell you a little story.

00:17:26.018 --> 00:17:27.410
See, once upon a time, Bobby called me,

00:17:27.508 --> 00:17:30.011
asked me to call him
if I got a whiff of this Bela Talbot.

00:17:30.046 --> 00:17:33.040
I got a whiff. I called. The end.

00:17:33.075 --> 00:17:34.871
Okay, yeah, if you could just
tell me where she is, I mean,

00:17:34.905 --> 00:17:36.303
that would be great.

00:17:36.906 --> 00:17:39.183
- Dean Winchester, right?
- Yeah.

00:17:39.205 --> 00:17:41.970
Dean, do I look like I'm here
to help you?

00:17:42.505 --> 00:17:44.052
I'm gonna say no.

00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:45.971
Then get the hell of my property.

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:47.492
All right, fair enough.

00:17:47.537 --> 00:17:49.541
I got one more question for you,
though.

00:17:50.008 --> 00:17:51.701
See, I got this, uh

00:17:51.705 --> 00:17:54.203
this bottle of scotch, and... uh,

00:17:54.975 --> 00:17:56.502
is this considered good?

00:18:02.437 --> 00:18:03.851
Bottoms up.

00:18:07.346 --> 00:18:09.983
You know,
I don't even bother drinking

00:18:10.027 --> 00:18:11.623
unless it's this stuff.

00:18:13.008 --> 00:18:15.460
Nectar of the gods, I'm telling you.

00:18:15.505 --> 00:18:17.103
Hey, it's a nice change, you know.

00:18:17.155 --> 00:18:19.313
Most of my whiskey's from a plastic jug.

00:18:21.608 --> 00:18:25.231
So, Bela was here because...

00:18:25.267 --> 00:18:27.341
She wanted to buy a couple of things,

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:30.601
which is gonna take me some time
to round up.

00:18:30.705 --> 00:18:32.150
Where is she now?

00:18:34.306 --> 00:18:36.162
Can I ask you something?

00:18:36.906 --> 00:18:38.102
Sure.

00:18:38.507 --> 00:18:40.473
You got three weeks left.

00:18:40.508 --> 00:18:41.970
Why are you wasting your time

00:18:42.006 --> 00:18:45.471
chasing after that
skinny, stuck-up english girl?

00:18:48.907 --> 00:18:50.352
How do you know about that?

00:18:54.306 --> 00:18:56.542
Because I know things.

00:18:58.505 --> 00:19:01.770
I know a lot of things
about a lot of people.

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:04.593
Is that so?

00:19:04.605 --> 00:19:07.421
I know ain't no peashooter
gonna save you.

00:19:10.505 --> 00:19:12.370
What makes you so sure?

00:19:13.608 --> 00:19:15.850
'Cause that's the job, kid.

00:19:16.507 --> 00:19:18.753
Even if you manage
to scrape out of this one,

00:19:18.847 --> 00:19:21.551
there'just gonna be something else
down the road.

00:19:22.705 --> 00:19:24.302
Folks like us...

00:19:25.007 --> 00:19:27.153
there ain't no happy ending.

00:19:28.277 --> 00:19:29.970
We all know it coming.

00:19:34.408 --> 00:19:36.610
Well, ain't you a bucket of sunshine?

00:19:41.705 --> 00:19:44.911
I'm what you've got
to look forward to if you survive.

00:19:48.506 --> 00:19:50.022
But you won't.

00:20:34.507 --> 00:20:35.870
So, Bela...

00:20:37.075 --> 00:20:38.881
Hotel Canaan.

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:41.323
Room 39.

00:20:43.307 --> 00:20:45.281
But watch your back.

00:20:45.506 --> 00:20:47.242
I think I can handle Bela.

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:49.560
Oh, don't be so sure about that.

00:20:49.606 --> 00:20:52.392
There are things
that you don't know about her.

00:20:53.007 --> 00:20:54.540
Oh, and you do?

00:20:54.605 --> 00:20:55.690
Right.

00:20:56.445 --> 00:20:58.042
Because you know things.

00:20:58.306 --> 00:20:59.222
Yep.

00:20:59.307 --> 00:21:01.493
And let me guess...
you lift her fingerprint?

00:21:01.508 --> 00:21:02.792
Yep.

00:21:03.418 --> 00:21:05.011
And that got you jack.

00:21:05.107 --> 00:21:06.333
Yep.

00:21:07.905 --> 00:21:09.402
She burnt them off.

00:21:10.807 --> 00:21:12.673
Probably years ago.

00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:14.983
Yeah, so you're right where we are.

00:21:15.018 --> 00:21:16.141
Nope.

00:21:20.505 --> 00:21:22.033
You do her ear?

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:24.040
Sorry?

00:21:24.108 --> 00:21:25.963
You do her ear?

00:21:29.007 --> 00:21:31.230
Hey, man, I'll try anything once,
but I don't know.

00:21:31.278 --> 00:21:32.793
That sounds uncomfortable.

00:21:34.506 --> 00:21:38.050
Ears are as unique to humans
as fingerprints.

00:21:38.907 --> 00:21:40.053
- No kidding.
- Of course,

00:21:40.096 --> 00:21:42.523
that don't fly in the
courts over here,

00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:46.713
but in England, they're all over it.

00:21:49.507 --> 00:21:51.362
A friend of a friend...

00:21:51.897 --> 00:21:53.270
of a friend

00:21:53.305 --> 00:21:56.152
faxed me 10 pages
of confidential files

00:21:56.207 --> 00:21:57.840
within a day.

00:21:58.587 --> 00:22:03.041
All I had to send him was
one clean shot off the security camera.

00:22:04.305 --> 00:22:05.512
Right.

00:22:06.506 --> 00:22:08.440
One clean shot of her ear.

00:22:24.688 --> 00:22:27.341
The so-called Bela Talbot.

00:24:52.556 --> 00:24:53.921
Shh! Shh! Shh!

00:24:53.976 --> 00:24:55.441
It's okay. I'm here to help you.

00:24:55.455 --> 00:24:57.023
I'm here to help you.
I'm gonna help you.

00:25:07.077 --> 00:25:10.290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay, here we go.

00:26:11.408 --> 00:26:12.892
Ok, watch your head.

00:26:15.005 --> 00:26:15.872
Sorry.

00:26:25.556 --> 00:26:27.650
Try to get straight. Try to get straight.

00:27:14.006 --> 00:27:15.883
- Where's the colt?
- Dean.

00:27:15.915 --> 00:27:17.582
No extra words.

00:27:18.006 --> 00:27:21.331
It's long gone,
across the world by now.

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:23.891
You're lying.

00:27:23.956 --> 00:27:25.962
I'll call the buyer. Speak farsi?

00:27:27.507 --> 00:27:28.740
What the hell...

00:27:28.795 --> 00:27:30.461
Don't flatter yourself.

00:27:33.008 --> 00:27:35.570
- Don't move.
- I told you I don't have it.

00:27:35.606 --> 00:27:38.052
Oh, yeah, I'm definitely
gonna take your word for it.

00:27:47.505 --> 00:27:48.943
Don't move.

00:28:00.088 --> 00:28:01.141
It's gone.

00:28:02.506 --> 00:28:04.383
Get on a plane if you must.

00:28:07.505 --> 00:28:10.251
Track down the buyer.
You might catch up to him eventually.

00:28:16.006 --> 00:28:17.472
Are you going to kill me?

00:28:17.506 --> 00:28:19.071
Oh, yeah.

00:28:20.408 --> 00:28:22.133
You're not the cold-blooded type.

00:28:22.206 --> 00:28:23.601
You mean like you?

00:28:23.605 --> 00:28:25.293
That's true.

00:28:25.308 --> 00:28:28.210
See, I couldn't imagine
killing my parents.

00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:32.080
- I don't know what you're talking...
- Yes, you do.

00:28:33.505 --> 00:28:35.483
You were, what, 14?

00:28:36.005 --> 00:28:38.393
Folks died in some shady car accident.

00:28:38.435 --> 00:28:40.280
Police suspected a slashed brake line,

00:28:40.306 --> 00:28:42.772
but it was all too crispy to tell.

00:28:42.807 --> 00:28:44.540
Cut to little Bela...

00:28:44.585 --> 00:28:46.932
Oh, I'm sorry, Abby...

00:28:47.006 --> 00:28:48.971
inheriting millions.

00:28:49.506 --> 00:28:51.573
- How did you ev...
- Doesn't matter.

00:29:16.926 --> 00:29:18.612
They were lovely people.

00:29:19.307 --> 00:29:21.001
And I killed them.

00:29:22.506 --> 00:29:23.932
And I got rich.

00:29:23.966 --> 00:29:26.432
I can't be bothered to give a damn.

00:29:28.308 --> 00:29:30.890
Just like I don't care
what happens to you.

00:29:39.005 --> 00:29:40.881
You make me sick.

00:29:42.906 --> 00:29:44.662
Likewise.

00:30:10.007 --> 00:30:11.583
You're not worth it.

00:30:41.508 --> 00:30:42.862
It worked.

00:30:43.307 --> 00:30:44.671
He found me.

00:30:46.006 --> 00:30:47.833
No, Sam wasn't with him.

00:30:49.008 --> 00:30:50.412
But I know where they are.

00:30:56.506 --> 00:30:58.200
- Dean?
- Yeah.

00:30:58.307 --> 00:31:00.421
- Did you get the colt?
- What do you think?

00:31:00.455 --> 00:31:01.921
So, does that mean Bela is...

00:31:01.955 --> 00:31:04.503
No, no, she deserves to die
a dozen times over,

00:31:04.538 --> 00:31:05.721
but I couldn't do it.

00:31:05.807 --> 00:31:07.320
I'm really screwed, Sammy.

00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:09.031
- No, you're just...
- But you were right.

00:31:09.066 --> 00:31:10.890
Bela was a goose chase.

00:31:12.306 --> 00:31:13.591
The colt's gone,

00:31:13.596 --> 00:31:16.163
and this time I'm really screwed, Sam.

00:31:16.206 --> 00:31:17.420
Maybe not.

00:31:18.005 --> 00:31:19.983
Look, I found Benton's cabin.

00:31:20.008 --> 00:31:21.963
- You okay? Was he there?
- Yeah.

00:31:22.006 --> 00:31:23.213
- Did you kill him?
- No.

00:31:23.257 --> 00:31:25.372
- What do you mean, "no"?
- Dean, please just listen for a second.

00:31:25.406 --> 00:31:28.101
I found his lab book,
and it has the formula.

00:31:28.146 --> 00:31:30.372
- What, the live-forever formula?</i
- Yeah.

00:31:30.446 --> 00:31:31.453
Great, let me guess.

00:31:31.496 --> 00:31:33.091
I got to drink blood
out of a baby's skull?

00:31:33.107 --> 00:31:36.280
No, that's the thing.
It's not black magic.

00:31:36.308 --> 00:31:38.840
There's no blood sacrifice or anything.

00:31:39.905 --> 00:31:41.612
It's just science, Dean.

00:31:41.706 --> 00:31:44.860
Very, very extremely weird science, but...

00:31:44.905 --> 00:31:46.611
Wait, wait, wait. What are...
What are you saying? You think...

00:31:46.655 --> 00:31:48.372
Dean, I think it might be doable.

00:31:48.428 --> 00:31:49.960
I mean,
I know we've hit a lot of walls, but I...

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:52.612
I think this formula,
I think it might be it.

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:54.370
This could save you.

00:31:54.887 --> 00:31:56.443
Okay, so, this formula...

00:31:56.506 --> 00:31:58.652
Well, I mean, look, look,
we're not in the clear yet.

00:31:58.705 --> 00:32:00.191
There are still things that I don't get.

00:32:02.005 --> 00:32:02.822
Sam?

00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:08.303
Sammy!

00:32:19.037 --> 00:32:21.190
You can relax.

00:32:21.507 --> 00:32:23.740
It's all gonna be okay.

00:32:23.806 --> 00:32:25.582
Ain't nothing gonna happen here

00:32:25.607 --> 00:32:27.850
that you got to worry about, Sammy.

00:32:27.928 --> 00:32:31.800
Your chances of coming out
of this procedure alive?

00:32:31.906 --> 00:32:34.041
Very, very high.

00:32:34.147 --> 00:32:35.720
How do you know my name?

00:32:36.905 --> 00:32:37.971
Oh...

00:32:40.006 --> 00:32:41.373
I know.

00:32:43.307 --> 00:32:46.521
You think I'm some kind of monster,
don't you?

00:32:46.707 --> 00:32:50.761
Well, I got to tell you,
I have never done one thing

00:32:50.807 --> 00:32:53.221
that I did not have to do.

00:32:53.266 --> 00:32:58.391
This whole eternal-life thing
is very high-maintenance.

00:33:00.047 --> 00:33:03.820
If something goes bad,
like my eyes here...

00:33:04.907 --> 00:33:07.080
you got to replace them.

00:33:11.905 --> 00:33:13.910
And sometimes things get damaged,

00:33:13.955 --> 00:33:18.713
like when your father cut out my heart.
Now, that...

00:33:18.808 --> 00:33:22.650
That was very inconvenient.

00:33:25.305 --> 00:33:28.491
So,
I'm sure that you can understand

00:33:28.507 --> 00:33:31.331
all the joy I felt

00:33:31.365 --> 00:33:36.052
when I read all
about myself here in his journal.

00:33:42.055 --> 00:33:44.440
Kind of makes this whole thing

00:33:45.508 --> 00:33:50.571
just feel like some
kind of family reunion, don't it?

00:33:51.905 --> 00:33:54.631
Well, I guess it's about time

00:33:55.005 --> 00:33:57.821
that we get this thing started.

00:34:14.406 --> 00:34:16.762
Shoot all you want.

00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:37.981
A knife?

00:34:40.507 --> 00:34:45.952
What part of immortality
do you not understand?

00:34:49.005 --> 00:34:51.931
Pity about the heart, though.

00:34:52.106 --> 00:34:55.320
It was a brand-new one.

00:34:55.408 --> 00:34:56.681
Good.

00:34:57.086 --> 00:34:59.381
It should be pumping nice and strong...

00:35:00.508 --> 00:35:04.543
Sending this stuff throughout
your whole body.

00:35:05.506 --> 00:35:06.982
See, I picked up your little

00:35:07.027 --> 00:35:09.580
bottle upstairs and dipped the knife in it.

00:35:23.978 --> 00:35:26.082
Oh, hiya, doc.

00:35:27.007 --> 00:35:29.260
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bac-y.

00:35:31.305 --> 00:35:33.370
- Please.
- Please what?

00:35:33.385 --> 00:35:35.532
You've been killing poor bastards
for over 150 years

00:35:35.575 --> 00:35:37.403
and now you got a request?
Shut up.

00:35:37.438 --> 00:35:40.170
No, you don't understand.
I can help you. I know

00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:41.390
what you need.

00:35:41.428 --> 00:35:43.091
We might have to cut him up
into little bits. You know,

00:35:43.126 --> 00:35:45.013
this immortality thing is a bitch.

00:35:45.048 --> 00:35:48.342
I can read the formula for you.

00:35:49.008 --> 00:35:52.291
The whole immortality...

00:35:52.306 --> 00:35:56.191
Forever young, never die.

00:36:14.517 --> 00:36:15.633
What?

00:36:18.508 --> 00:36:20.100
I mean,
we're talking hell in three weeks.

00:36:20.137 --> 00:36:22.332
Or needing a new pancreas
in like half a century.

00:36:22.336 --> 00:36:24.110
Yeah, well, you can't exactly get those
at a kwik-e-mart.

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:26.731
It's not perfect, but it buys us more time
to think of something better.

00:36:26.805 --> 00:36:29.161
We just need time, Dean.
I mean, please, just...

00:36:29.665 --> 00:36:31.281
just think about it.

00:36:34.905 --> 00:36:35.992
No.

00:36:36.507 --> 00:36:38.811
- Dean, don't you want to live?
- What he is isn't living.

00:36:38.855 --> 00:36:40.220
- Look, this is simple.
- Simple?

00:36:40.258 --> 00:36:43.480
To me it is, okay.
Black or white; human, not human.

00:36:45.007 --> 00:36:46.661
See, what the doc is

00:36:46.668 --> 00:36:48.562
is a freakin' monster.

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:50.091
I can't do it.

00:36:50.607 --> 00:36:52.441
I would rather go to hell.

00:36:52.986 --> 00:36:56.340
You don't understand.
I can help you!

00:36:59.738 --> 00:37:01.541
Now, I'm gonna take care of him.

00:37:02.006 --> 00:37:04.070
You can help me or not.
It's up to you.

00:37:35.018 --> 00:37:36.371
No! No!

00:37:36.446 --> 00:37:38.193
Don't! Stop it!

00:37:38.238 --> 00:37:40.701
I can help you! No!

00:37:40.747 --> 00:37:42.560
Enjoy forever in there, doc.

00:37:44.385 --> 00:37:45.773
Let me out!

00:37:50.475 --> 00:37:52.963
I can save you!

00:37:53.005 --> 00:37:54.873
No. Don't.

00:39:08.398 --> 00:39:09.570
Hiya, Bela.

00:39:09.615 --> 00:39:11.711
Here's a fun fact you may not know...

00:39:11.746 --> 00:39:13.483
I felt your hand in my pocket

00:39:13.498 --> 00:39:15.153
when you swiped that motel receipt.

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:16.160
You don't understand.

00:39:16.206 --> 00:39:18.551
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I understand perfectly.

00:39:18.608 --> 00:39:21.040
You see, I noticed something interesting
in your hotel room,

00:39:21.105 --> 00:39:24.400
something tucked above the door.
An herb...

00:39:24.447 --> 00:39:26.200
devil's shoestring.

00:39:26.705 --> 00:39:28.730
Well, there's only one use for that...

00:39:29.105 --> 00:39:31.143
holding hellhounds at bay.

00:39:31.507 --> 00:39:32.600
So, you know what I did?
I went back,

00:39:32.606 --> 00:39:34.552
and I took another look at
your folks' obit.

00:39:34.598 --> 00:39:37.351
Turns out they died 10 years ago today.

00:39:38.005 --> 00:39:39.520
You didn't kill them.

00:39:39.866 --> 00:39:41.923
A demon did your dirty work.

00:39:41.956 --> 00:39:44.802
You made a deal, didn't you, Bela?

00:39:44.958 --> 00:39:46.781
And it's come due.

00:39:53.028 --> 00:39:54.880
I can take care of them for you.

00:39:57.406 --> 00:39:59.332
And it won't even cost you anything.

00:40:01.508 --> 00:40:04.981
For 10 whole years.

00:40:10.507 --> 00:40:13.161
Is that why you stole the colt, huh?

00:40:13.508 --> 00:40:15.060
To try to wiggle out of your deal?

00:40:15.105 --> 00:40:17.681
- Our gun for your soul?
- Yes.

00:40:17.718 --> 00:40:20.071
But stealing the colt
wasn't quite enough, I'm guessing.

00:40:20.157 --> 00:40:21.831
They changed the deal.

00:40:23.008 --> 00:40:24.772
They wanted me to kill Sam.

00:40:24.807 --> 00:40:26.541
Really? Wow.

00:40:26.607 --> 00:40:28.262
Demons untrustworthy...

00:40:28.507 --> 00:40:29.703
Shocker.

00:40:30.406 --> 00:40:32.312
That's kind of a tight deadline, too.

00:40:32.387 --> 00:40:33.841
What time is it?

00:40:33.906 --> 00:40:37.141
Oh, look at that. Almost midnight.

00:40:37.505 --> 00:40:39.442
Dean, listen, I need help.

00:40:39.506 --> 00:40:41.443
Sweetheart, we are weeks past help.

00:40:41.488 --> 00:40:43.092
I know I don't deserve it.

00:40:43.126 --> 00:40:44.170
You know what? You're right.
You don't.

00:40:44.206 --> 00:40:45.960
But you know
what the bitch of the bunch is?

00:40:46.006 --> 00:40:49.070
If you would have just come to us sooner
and asked for help,

00:40:49.107 --> 00:40:51.321
we probably could have taken the colt
and saved you.

00:40:51.607 --> 00:40:53.823
I know, and saved yourself.

00:40:54.508 --> 00:40:56.400
I know about your deal, Dean.

00:40:56.485 --> 00:40:57.772
Wnd who told you that?

00:40:57.808 --> 00:40:59.473
The demon that holds it.

00:40:59.505 --> 00:41:01.012
She holds mine, too.

00:41:01.506 --> 00:41:04.021
- She says she holds every deal.
- She?

00:41:04.107 --> 00:41:05.280
Her name's Lilith.

00:41:06.006 --> 00:41:07.141
Lilith?

00:41:09.007 --> 00:41:10.421
Why should I believe you?

00:41:11.236 --> 00:41:13.450
You shouldn't, but it's the truth.

00:41:13.487 --> 00:41:15.040
This can't help you, Bela.

00:41:15.516 --> 00:41:17.562
Not now.
Why are you telling me this?

00:41:18.006 --> 00:41:20.922
Because just maybe you can kill the bitch.

00:41:25.008 --> 00:41:26.761
I'll see you in hell.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
