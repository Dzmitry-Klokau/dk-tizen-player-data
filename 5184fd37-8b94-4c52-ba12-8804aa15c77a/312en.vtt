01:15.920 --> 01:16.710
- Any sign of it?
- Nothing.


01:18.400 --> 01:20.470
Are you sure this is bela's room?


01:21.562 --> 01:22.830
I'd say so.


01:38.700 --> 01:39.800
Dean?


01:39.900 --> 01:41.699
Sweetie, are you there?


01:41.700 --> 01:42.899
Where are you?


01:42.900 --> 01:44.600
Two states away by now.


01:44.700 --> 01:47.061
- Where?
- Where's our usual quippy banter? I miss it.


01:47.070 --> 01:48.845
I want it back, bela... now.


01:48.854 --> 01:52.316
Your little pistol, you mean?
Sorry. I can't at the moment.


01:52.317 --> 01:54.534
You understand how many
people are gonna die if you do this?


01:54.535 --> 01:56.920
What exactly is it that
you think i plan to do with it?


01:56.921 --> 02:01.259
Take the only weapon we have against an
army of demons and sell it to the highest bidder.


02:02.104 --> 02:04.838
- You know nothing about me.
- I know i'm gonna stop you.


02:04.839 --> 02:07.099
Tough words for a guy
who can't even find me.


02:07.100 --> 02:09.513
Oh, i'll find you, sweetheart.
You know why?


02:09.600 --> 02:12.200
Because i have absolutely
nothing better to do


02:12.300 --> 02:15.296
- Than to track you down.
- That's where you're wrong.


02:15.300 --> 02:17.599
You're about to be quite occupied.


02:18.118 --> 02:20.662
Did you really think
i wouldn't take precautions?


02:21.883 --> 02:23.300
Hands in the air!


02:28.895 --> 02:32.032
- That bitch!
- Turn around! Now!


02:33.833 --> 02:36.766
Sam and dean winchester, you
have the right to remain silent.


02:36.767 --> 02:39.810
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.


02:39.811 --> 02:44.041
You have the right to speak to an attorney and
have an attorney present during any questioning.


02:44.042 --> 02:48.258
If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be
appointed for you at government expense.


02:48.259 --> 02:49.500
Hi, guys.


02:51.666 --> 02:53.093
It's been a while.


02:56.300 --> 03:03.093
Supernatural 312
synchro : Flolo - Transcript: Yyets.Net


03:09.833 --> 03:12.792
- So, did you get them?
- Where is everyone? I asked for all your men.


03:12.793 --> 03:15.051
And you got them.
They went with you on the raid.


03:15.052 --> 03:16.599
Four men? That's all?


03:16.600 --> 03:19.187
Everyone i could drum up
with an hour's notice.


03:19.188 --> 03:21.743
We're a small town, agent henriksen.


03:30.493 --> 03:32.884
- What's he in for?
- Drunk and disorderly.


03:32.885 --> 03:34.400
Keys.


03:34.500 --> 03:35.979
Now.


03:38.012 --> 03:40.075
What are you doing?


03:41.500 --> 03:44.399
It is your lucky night, sir.
You are free to go.


03:44.400 --> 03:47.499
- What the hell are you doing?
- This way.


03:47.500 --> 03:51.032
Agent henriksen, you can't
just release my prisoners.


03:52.000 --> 03:54.299
Agent henriksen.


03:54.300 --> 03:57.987
- Look. I get it... you're may berry p.D.
- Excuse me?


03:57.988 --> 04:00.127
And this isn't how i'd do it
if i had my choice,


04:00.128 --> 04:02.899
But a tip's a tip,
and we had to move fast.


04:02.900 --> 04:06.410
Look, agent, this ain't my first rodeo.


04:06.411 --> 04:09.363
You've never been
to a rodeo like this before.


04:09.364 --> 04:11.499
You have any idea who we're
about to bring in here?


04:11.500 --> 04:12.900
Yeah... a couple of fugitives.


04:13.000 --> 04:15.499
The most dangerous criminals you've
ever laid your eyeballs on.


04:15.500 --> 04:19.556
Think hannibal lecter and his half-Wit little
brother. Do you know what these guys do for kicks?


04:19.557 --> 04:23.699
Dig up graves and mutilate corpses. They're not just killers,
sheriff. They're satan-Worshipping, nutbag killers.


04:23.700 --> 04:27.815
So work with me here. I'll get them out your hair
and on their way to supermax,


04:27.816 --> 04:31.477
And you'll be home
in enough time to watch the farm report.


04:31.500 --> 04:33.300
However we can help.


04:34.800 --> 04:38.600
Those men of yours...
post them at the exits.


04:39.504 --> 04:41.100
Yes, sir.


04:42.400 --> 04:45.199
Reidy, bring them in.


04:45.200 --> 04:47.800
I guess we're as ready
as we're gonna be.


05:07.617 --> 05:09.600
Why all the sourpusses?


05:11.600 --> 05:14.254
I'll show you to the cells.


05:14.500 --> 05:17.295
Hey! Hey!
Watch the merchandise!


05:18.425 --> 05:21.000
We're not the ones
you should be scared of, nancy.


05:34.030 --> 05:35.700
Dean, come on!


05:36.280 --> 05:37.499
All right.
All right.


05:37.500 --> 05:40.090
- Sit?
- Yeah.


05:51.785 --> 05:53.799
How we gonna
houdini out of this one?


05:53.800 --> 05:55.580
Good question.


06:01.400 --> 06:03.730
It's me.
Steven in?


06:03.784 --> 06:05.945
Well, get him
out of the meeting.


06:12.908 --> 06:15.204
- Groves.
- I got them.


06:15.354 --> 06:17.398
Well, i'll be damned.


06:17.603 --> 06:21.324
I was betting on your headstone reading
"couldn't catch the winchester boys."


06:21.325 --> 06:23.899
- Well, they'll be at supermax by morning.
- How?


06:23.900 --> 06:25.647
Armored bus, loaded with men.


06:25.648 --> 06:27.799
A bus? What, are you trying
to give me another ulcer?


06:27.800 --> 06:31.893
- Look, we're taking every precaution.
- Like the last time? And the time before that?


06:31.894 --> 06:34.006
Screw that.
I'm sending a chopper.


06:34.007 --> 06:37.310
- Whatever you think is best.
- Damn right. And i'll be on it.


06:37.311 --> 06:42.447
I can't take you losing those boys again. They
have been a primary thorn in my ass for months.


06:42.448 --> 06:43.599
- So, victor...
- Yeah?


06:43.600 --> 06:46.300
Glue your eyeballs to them
till i get there.


06:47.800 --> 06:51.199
- There's a chopper on its way.
- But we don't have a helicopter pad.


06:51.200 --> 06:53.800
Then clear
the damn parking lot.


07:06.622 --> 07:08.985
You know
what i'm trying to decide?


07:08.986 --> 07:12.288
I don't know. What? Whether cialis will
help you with your little condition?


07:12.289 --> 07:14.700
What to have for dinner
tonight.


07:14.800 --> 07:17.999
Steak or lobster. What the hell.


07:18.000 --> 07:19.699
Surf and turf.


07:19.700 --> 07:24.588
I got a lot to celebrate. I mean, after all,
seeing you two in chains...


07:24.589 --> 07:27.399
You kinky son of a bitch.
We don't swing that way.


07:27.400 --> 07:29.000
Now, that's funny.


07:29.561 --> 07:32.678
You know, i wouldn't bust out
the melted butter just yet.


07:32.679 --> 07:34.499
Couldn't catch us
at the bank.


07:34.500 --> 07:37.100
Couldn't keep us in that jail.


07:38.700 --> 07:42.999
You're right. Screwed up.
I underestimated you.


07:43.000 --> 07:46.779
I didn't count on you
being that smart. But now i'm ready.


07:46.780 --> 07:49.799
- Yeah, ready to lose us again?
- Ready like a court order to keep you


07:49.800 --> 07:54.199
In a supermaximum prison in nevada till trial. Ready
like isolation in a soundproof, windowless cell


07:54.200 --> 07:56.099
So small that, between you and me...


07:56.100 --> 07:58.663
Probably unconstitutional.


07:59.200 --> 08:01.080
How's that for ready?


08:04.643 --> 08:06.401
Take a good look at sam.


08:06.402 --> 08:08.800
You two will never
see each other again.


08:10.200 --> 08:13.248
Where's that smug smile, dean?


08:13.249 --> 08:14.976
I want to see it.


08:16.780 --> 08:22.339
- You got the wrong guys.
- Oh, yeah. I forgot. You fight monsters.


08:22.412 --> 08:25.999
Sorry, dean. Truth is, your daddy brainwashed
you with all that devil talk


08:26.000 --> 08:28.543
And no doubt touched you in a bad place.


08:28.544 --> 08:31.399
- That's all. That's reality.
- Why don't you shut your mouth?


08:31.400 --> 08:35.999
Well, guess what. Life sucks. Get a helmet.
'Cause everybody's got a sob story,


08:36.000 --> 08:39.086
But not everybody
becomes a killer.


08:44.100 --> 08:48.281
And now i have two less
to worry about.


08:52.566 --> 08:54.900
It's surf-And-Turf time.


09:08.352 --> 09:09.599
Steven.


09:09.600 --> 09:11.300
Gentlemen.


09:13.612 --> 09:15.074
What's all this?


09:15.075 --> 09:19.099
What can i say? The fbi
didn't invent bureaucracy. We perfected it.


09:19.100 --> 09:22.499
- You want me to do all this now?
- Sorry. Now, victor.


09:22.500 --> 09:26.000
I'm gonna go take a good,
long gander at our fugitives.


09:48.944 --> 09:50.747
Sam and dean winchester.


09:50.748 --> 09:53.597
I'm deputy director steven groves.


09:53.598 --> 09:56.174
This is a pleasure.


09:56.175 --> 09:59.262
- Well, glad one of us feels that way.
- I've been waiting a long time


09:59.263 --> 10:01.689
For you two to come out of the woodwork.


10:26.472 --> 10:30.685
Sorry. Got to cut this short.
It's gonna be a long night, fellas.


10:36.800 --> 10:38.900
What the hell
was that?


10:41.577 --> 10:44.082
- Put the gun down!
- Wait. Okay, wait.


10:44.083 --> 10:46.196
- He shot him!
- I didn't shoot him. I didn't shoot anyone.


10:46.197 --> 10:48.199
- He shot me!
- Get on your knees now!


10:48.200 --> 10:51.655
Okay, okay, okay.
Don't shoot. Please. Look. Here. Here.


10:53.761 --> 10:58.060
We didn't shoot him. Check the body.
There's no blood. We did not kill him.


11:04.799 --> 11:07.799
- Vic, there's no bullet wound.
- He's probably been dead for months.


11:07.800 --> 11:09.920
- What did you do to him?
- We didn't do anything!


11:09.921 --> 11:12.805
- Talk, or i shoot.
- You won't believe us.


11:13.500 --> 11:15.694
He was possessed.


11:15.800 --> 11:17.500
Possessed? Right.


11:17.600 --> 11:20.112
Fire up the chopper.
We're taking them out of here now.


11:20.113 --> 11:22.803
- Yeah. Do that.
- Bill?


11:25.110 --> 11:27.091
Bill, are you there?


12:08.300 --> 12:11.599
They're dead.
I think they're all dead.


12:13.300 --> 12:15.394
What the hell was that? Reidy?


12:15.745 --> 12:17.481
Reidy?!


12:19.054 --> 12:19.956
Reidy?


12:21.600 --> 12:23.909
What the hell was that?


12:40.310 --> 12:42.270
- Hello?
- My men. Agent henriksen?


12:40.310 --> 12:45.150
- What the hell's happening out there?
- I can't get a line. All the phones are out.


12:43.423 --> 12:45.684
Henriksen!
Four of my men!


12:47.600 --> 12:52.120
The internet, my cell... it's all dead.
How can it all be dead?


13:03.500 --> 13:06.299
- That can't be good.
- Oh, my god.


13:06.300 --> 13:09.701
No. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. We're
gonna go. We're gonna go... right now.


13:09.702 --> 13:12.283
Nobody's going anywhere.
Everybody, calm down.


13:12.284 --> 13:14.278
Your partner is out there!
My men are out there!


13:14.279 --> 13:17.009
I know. We go out there,
we're asking to die, too.


13:17.010 --> 13:18.753
- Don't you get it?
- Get what?


13:18.754 --> 13:21.199
They're out there, and they're coming
in here. This is a siege.


13:21.200 --> 13:25.499
So this might be a good time for you to
lock the doors and the windows, take a breath,


13:25.500 --> 13:29.853
And maybe deal with this like trained
professionals with some sense in their heads.


13:42.000 --> 13:43.534
You okay?


13:45.900 --> 13:49.109
I wouldn't think so. Nancy, right?


13:49.506 --> 13:51.999
I'm gonna get you through this.
You got my word.


13:52.368 --> 13:53.830
You got that?


13:56.910 --> 13:59.199
All right,
don't be such a wuss.


13:59.200 --> 14:01.138
What's the plan?


14:01.329 --> 14:03.900
Kill everyone in the station, bust you two out?


14:04.000 --> 14:06.770
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm talking about your psycho friends.


14:06.771 --> 14:08.659
I'm talking about a bloodbath.


14:08.660 --> 14:12.611
Okay, i promise you, whoever's out
there is not here to help us.


14:12.612 --> 14:15.999
Look, you got to believe us. Everyone here
is in terrible danger.


14:16.000 --> 14:18.497
Why don't you let us out of here
so we can save your asses?


14:18.498 --> 14:19.945
From what?


14:20.300 --> 14:22.611
You gonna say "demons"?


14:22.612 --> 14:26.234
Don't you dare say "demons."


14:26.235 --> 14:28.351
Let me tell you something.


14:28.352 --> 14:30.600
You should be
a lot more scared of me.


14:34.700 --> 14:36.343
How's the shoulder?


14:37.900 --> 14:39.707
It's awesome.


14:41.300 --> 14:43.299
I'll live.


14:43.300 --> 14:46.099
You know,
if we get out of here alive.


14:46.100 --> 14:48.275
So, you got a plan?


14:56.600 --> 15:01.787
Uh, please. Please. We need your
help. It's... it's nancy. Nancy, right?


15:01.882 --> 15:04.920
Nancy, my... my brother's been shot.
He's... he's bleeding really bad.


15:04.921 --> 15:09.321
You think maybe you could get us
a towel? Please? Just one clean towel?


15:11.171 --> 15:13.890
Look. Look at us.
We're not the bad guys, i swear.


15:19.100 --> 15:21.029
Nice try.


15:28.640 --> 15:30.089
Thank you.


15:33.700 --> 15:35.439
It's okay.


15:40.700 --> 15:42.300
Thank you.


15:50.258 --> 15:51.800
Thanks.


15:56.800 --> 15:58.900
Let her go!
Let her go!


16:02.200 --> 16:03.800
You okay, nance?


16:05.600 --> 16:10.204
Try something again,
get shot. And not in the arm.


16:16.000 --> 16:18.208
What the hell was that?


16:27.800 --> 16:30.099
We're like sitting ducks in here.


16:30.100 --> 16:31.499
Yeah, i know.


16:31.842 --> 16:34.506
Would it kill these cops
to bring us a snack?!


16:34.507 --> 16:36.999
- How many you figure are out there?
- I don't know.


16:37.000 --> 16:40.907
However many there are, they could be possessing
anyone. Anyone could just walk right in.


16:40.908 --> 16:43.148
It's kind of wild, right?


16:43.257 --> 16:45.577
I mean, it's like
they're coming right for us.


16:45.714 --> 16:47.969
They've never done that before.


16:50.004 --> 16:52.395
It's like we got
a contract on us.


16:53.000 --> 16:54.999
Think it's because we're so awesome?


16:55.000 --> 16:57.717
I think it's 'cause we're so awesome.


17:02.454 --> 17:05.365
Well, howdy, there, sheriff.


17:11.394 --> 17:14.332
- Uh, sheriff?
- It's time to go, boys.


17:15.700 --> 17:18.487
Uh... you know what?


17:18.488 --> 17:21.294
We're just comfy right here.
But thank you.


17:21.390 --> 17:23.200
What do you think
you're doing?


17:23.300 --> 17:26.362
We're not just gonna sit around here and
wait to die. We're gonna make a run for it.


17:26.363 --> 17:29.468
- It's safer here.
- There's a swat facility in boulder.


17:29.469 --> 17:32.462
- We're not going anywhere.
- The hell we're not.


17:42.695 --> 17:44.200
Stay back!


17:52.400 --> 17:55.564
- Hurry up!
- It's too late.


17:55.565 --> 17:58.823
I already called them.
They're already coming.


18:24.100 --> 18:25.400
Is he...


18:25.500 --> 18:27.321
Is he dead?


18:29.900 --> 18:31.610
Henriksen.


18:31.611 --> 18:34.277
Hey.
Is that you in there?


18:47.864 --> 18:49.859
I shot the sheriff.


18:51.200 --> 18:53.430
But you didn't shoot the deputy.


18:59.390 --> 19:01.753
Five minutes ago,
i was fine, and then...


19:01.754 --> 19:04.599
Let me guess...
some nasty black smoke


19:04.600 --> 19:07.067
Jammed itself down your throat?


19:08.727 --> 19:10.968
You were possessed.


19:11.700 --> 19:13.200
Possessed like...


19:13.300 --> 19:14.599
Possessed.


19:14.600 --> 19:17.366
That's what it feels like.
Now you know.


19:17.722 --> 19:20.200
I owe you the biggest
"i told you so" ever.


19:32.484 --> 19:34.400
Officer amici.


19:34.500 --> 19:36.401
Keys.


19:43.005 --> 19:44.631
All right.


19:44.632 --> 19:46.828
So, how do we survive?


20:04.512 --> 20:07.233
Well, that's nice.
It's not gonna do much good.


20:07.234 --> 20:11.113
- We got an arsenal here.
- You don't poke a bear with a bb gun.


20:11.114 --> 20:13.899
- That's just gonna make him mad.
- What do you need?


20:13.900 --> 20:16.099
- Salt. Lots and lots of salt.
- Salt?


20:16.100 --> 20:18.453
What, is there an echo in here?


20:18.454 --> 20:20.799
There's road salt
in the storeroom.


20:20.800 --> 20:22.396
Perfect.


20:22.397 --> 20:25.708
Perfect. We need salt
at every window and every door.


20:31.200 --> 20:33.100
How you holding up,
nancy?


20:33.200 --> 20:34.906
Okay.


20:36.591 --> 20:38.532
When i was little,


20:38.533 --> 20:42.058
I would come home from church
and talk about the devil.


20:42.059 --> 20:44.000
My parents would tell me
to stop being so literal.


20:47.100 --> 20:49.400
I guess i showed them,
huh?


20:51.156 --> 20:52.727
That should hold.


20:52.728 --> 20:54.200
Thank you.


20:58.251 --> 21:00.399
Hey, where's my car?


21:00.400 --> 21:02.639
Impound lot out back.


21:02.640 --> 21:04.197
Wait.


21:04.198 --> 21:06.313
You're not
going out there?


21:06.924 --> 21:09.453
Yeah. I got to get something
out of my trunk.


22:28.700 --> 22:30.600
They're coming!


22:34.575 --> 22:36.300
Hurry!


23:27.500 --> 23:30.132
- Everybody okay?
- Define "okay."


23:30.230 --> 23:32.800
All right, everybody needs
to put these on.


23:32.800 --> 23:35.397
They'll keep you
from being possessed.


23:39.351 --> 23:41.647
What about you and sam?


23:44.597 --> 23:47.596
- Smart.
- How long you had those?


23:47.597 --> 23:49.687
Not long enough.


24:06.997 --> 24:09.237
Hey, that's jenna rubner.


24:12.097 --> 24:13.896
It's not jenna anymore.


24:13.897 --> 24:16.396
That's where all that
black demon smoke went?


24:16.397 --> 24:18.149
Looks like.


24:41.485 --> 24:43.999
Shotgun shells full of salt.


24:45.020 --> 24:49.202
- Whatever works.
- Fighting off monsters with condiments.


24:50.407 --> 24:53.741
So, turns out
demons are real.


24:55.139 --> 24:57.997
F.Y.I...
ghosts are real, too.


24:58.424 --> 25:02.496
So are werewolves,
vampires, changelings,


25:02.497 --> 25:04.832
Evil clowns that eat people.


25:05.637 --> 25:07.372
Okay, then.


25:07.373 --> 25:09.848
If it makes you feel better,
bigfoot's a hoax.


25:10.797 --> 25:12.536
It doesn't.


25:14.297 --> 25:15.949
How many demons?


25:15.950 --> 25:17.396
Total?


25:17.397 --> 25:18.897
No clue.


25:18.997 --> 25:20.936
A lot.


25:22.342 --> 25:24.610
You know what my job is?


25:25.797 --> 25:28.804
You mean besides
locking up the good guys?


25:29.297 --> 25:30.922
I have no idea.


25:31.197 --> 25:32.897
My job is boring.


25:32.997 --> 25:34.425
It's frustrating.


25:34.426 --> 25:36.896
You work three years for one break,


25:36.897 --> 25:40.696
And then maybe you can save...
a few people. Maybe.


25:41.146 --> 25:43.097
That's the payoff.


25:43.197 --> 25:45.196
I've been busting my ass for 15 years


25:45.197 --> 25:47.397
To nail a handful of guys,
and all this while,


25:47.497 --> 25:49.597
There was something
off in the corner so big.


25:49.697 --> 25:51.096
So, yeah.


25:51.097 --> 25:54.696
Sign me up for that big, frosty
mug of wasting my damn life.


25:54.697 --> 25:56.196
You didn't know.


25:56.197 --> 25:57.897
Now i do.


26:02.697 --> 26:04.477
What's out there?


26:04.788 --> 26:06.647
Can you guys beat it?


26:06.901 --> 26:08.507
Can you win?


26:10.816 --> 26:13.997
Honestly, i think
the world's gonna end bloody.


26:15.297 --> 26:17.269
But it doesn't mean
we shouldn't fight.


26:17.797 --> 26:19.196
We do have choices.


26:19.197 --> 26:21.426
I choose to go down swingin'.


26:24.997 --> 26:27.874
Plus, you got nothing
to go home to but your brother.


26:28.897 --> 26:30.013
Yeah.


26:31.679 --> 26:34.597
What about you? You rockin'
the white picket fence?


26:35.020 --> 26:37.800
Empty apartment,
string of angry ex-Wives.


26:38.393 --> 26:40.308
I'm right where you are.


26:42.897 --> 26:44.498
Imagine that.


26:49.568 --> 26:51.396
- How do we kill her?
- We don't.


26:51.397 --> 26:53.596
- She's a demon.
- She's here to help us.


26:53.597 --> 26:55.518
Are you kidding?


27:00.378 --> 27:02.223
Are you gonna let me out?


27:09.397 --> 27:11.797
And they say chivalry's dead.


27:12.866 --> 27:15.933
Does anyone have a breath mint?
Some guts splattered in my mouth


27:15.934 --> 27:18.681
While i was killing my way in here.


27:30.045 --> 27:34.496
- How many are out there?
- 30, at least. That's so far.


27:34.497 --> 27:37.796
Oh, good. 30.
30 hit men, all gunning for us.


27:37.797 --> 27:40.178
Who sent them?


27:41.287 --> 27:43.296
You didn't tell dean?


27:43.421 --> 27:45.196
I'm surprised.


27:45.197 --> 27:47.596
- Tell me what?
- There's a big new up-And-Comer.


27:47.597 --> 27:50.096
Real pied piper.


27:50.097 --> 27:52.396
- Who is he?
- Not he.


27:52.397 --> 27:54.095
Her.


27:54.096 --> 27:56.196
- Her name is lilith.
- Lilith?


27:56.197 --> 27:59.796
And she really, really wants
sam's intestines on a stick.


27:59.797 --> 28:02.596
'Cause she sees him as competition.


28:02.597 --> 28:04.422
You knew about this?


28:06.597 --> 28:09.451
Well, gee, sam, is there
anything else i should know?!


28:10.297 --> 28:12.796
How about the two of you
talk about this later?


28:12.797 --> 28:14.590
We'll need the colt.


28:20.073 --> 28:22.014
Where's the colt?


28:23.397 --> 28:26.496
- It got stolen.
- I'm sorry. I must have blood in my ear.


28:26.497 --> 28:28.997
I thought i just heard you say
that you were stupid enough


28:29.097 --> 28:32.893
To let the colt get grabbed out of
your thick, clumsy, idiotic hands.


28:34.597 --> 28:36.497
Fantastic.


28:37.371 --> 28:39.396
This is just peachy.


28:39.397 --> 28:41.297
- Ruby...
- Shut up.


28:44.597 --> 28:46.197
Fine.


28:48.316 --> 28:50.997
Since i don't see
that there's any other option,


28:51.097 --> 28:53.932
There's one other way i know how
to get you out of here alive.


28:54.031 --> 28:56.896
- What's that?
- I know a spell.


28:56.897 --> 29:00.764
It'll vaporize every demon
in a one-Mile radius...


29:00.765 --> 29:02.923
Myself included.


29:03.556 --> 29:07.546
So, you let the colt out of your sight,
and now i have to die.


29:08.302 --> 29:10.896
So, next time, be more careful.


29:10.897 --> 29:13.737
How's that for a dying wish?


29:17.106 --> 29:20.295
Okay.
What do we need to do?


29:20.472 --> 29:24.240
You can't do anything. This spell
is very specific.


29:24.297 --> 29:25.997
It calls
for a person of virtue.


29:27.297 --> 29:29.282
I got virtue.


29:29.658 --> 29:32.897
Nice try.
You're not a virgin.


29:33.997 --> 29:35.997
Nobody's a virgin.


29:47.173 --> 29:48.396
No.


29:48.397 --> 29:49.997
No way.


29:50.097 --> 29:53.653
- You're kidding me. You're...
- What? It's a choice, okay?


29:53.697 --> 29:56.296
So, y-You've never...


29:56.608 --> 29:58.297
Not even once?


29:58.397 --> 30:00.313
I mean, not even...


30:03.497 --> 30:05.896
So, this spell...


30:05.897 --> 30:07.596
What can i do?


30:07.597 --> 30:09.545
You can hold still.


30:10.280 --> 30:12.453
While i cut your heart
out of your chest.


30:12.454 --> 30:13.697
- What?
- What are you, crazy?


30:13.698 --> 30:16.584
- I'm offering a solution.
- You're offering to kill somebody.


30:16.585 --> 30:19.106
And what do you think's gonna happen to
this girl when the demons get in?


30:19.107 --> 30:21.396
- We're gonna protect her. That's what.
- Very noble.


30:21.397 --> 30:24.396
- Excuse me.
- You're all gonna die. Look, this is the only way.


30:24.397 --> 30:27.889
- Yeah, yeah. There's no way that you're gonna...
- Would everybody please shut up?!


30:28.897 --> 30:31.096
All the people out there...


30:31.097 --> 30:32.898
Will it save them?


30:32.899 --> 30:35.199
It'll blow the demons out of their bodies.


30:35.200 --> 30:38.513
So if their bodies
are okay... yeah.


30:45.035 --> 30:46.361
I'll do it.


30:46.362 --> 30:48.212
- No, no. You don't need to do this.
- Hell no!


30:48.213 --> 30:50.996
- All my friends are out there.
- We don't sacrifice people.


30:50.997 --> 30:53.787
We do that,
we're no better than them.


30:55.367 --> 30:57.226
We don't have a choice.


30:57.227 --> 31:01.182
- Yeah, well, your choice is not a choice.
- Sam, you know i'm right.


31:05.897 --> 31:06.997
Sam.


31:08.597 --> 31:10.795
What the hell is going on?
Sam, tell her.


31:11.991 --> 31:13.821
It's my decision.


31:13.822 --> 31:15.696
Damn straight, cherry pie.


31:15.697 --> 31:17.170
Stop!


31:17.171 --> 31:18.796
Stop!


31:18.797 --> 31:21.197
Nobody kill any virgins!


31:23.197 --> 31:25.797
Sam,
i need to talk to you.


31:30.561 --> 31:32.788
Please tell me you're not
actually considering this.


31:32.789 --> 31:34.797
We're talking about holding down a
girl and cutting out her heart.


31:34.798 --> 31:37.296
And we're also talking about
30 people out there, dean...


31:37.297 --> 31:41.073
Innocent people who are all gonna die,
along with everyone in here.


31:41.074 --> 31:44.769
It doesn't mean that we throw away the
rule book and stop acting like humans.


31:45.097 --> 31:48.520
I'm not gonna let that demon
kill some nice, sweet, innocent girl


31:48.521 --> 31:50.396
Who hasn't even been laid.


31:50.397 --> 31:53.097
I mean, look, if that's how you win
wars, then i don't want to win.


31:53.098 --> 31:55.697
Then what?
What do we do, dean?


32:01.335 --> 32:04.196
I got a plan. I'm not saying
it's a good one.


32:04.197 --> 32:07.496
I'm not even saying that it'll work.
But it sure as hell beats killing a virgin.


32:07.497 --> 32:09.297
Okay, so, what's the plan?


32:09.397 --> 32:12.297
Open the doors,
let them all in...


32:12.397 --> 32:14.271
And we fight.


32:20.797 --> 32:23.296
- Get the equipment to work?
- Yeah.


32:23.297 --> 32:25.500
- So?
- So, this is insane.


32:25.501 --> 32:28.154
You win "understatement of the year."
Look, i get it. You think...


32:28.155 --> 32:30.096
I don't think... i know.


32:30.097 --> 32:32.578
It's not gonna work.


32:33.397 --> 32:35.126
So long, boys.


32:35.127 --> 32:38.102
- So, you're just gonna leave?
- Hey.


32:38.397 --> 32:41.258
I was gonna kill myself
to help you win.


32:41.932 --> 32:44.638
I'm not gonna stand here
and watch you lose.


32:47.997 --> 32:50.997
And i'm disappointed...
because i tried.


32:51.097 --> 32:53.196
I really did.


32:53.549 --> 32:56.802
But, clearly,
i bet on the wrong horse.


33:01.297 --> 33:03.597
Do you mind letting me out?


33:19.597 --> 33:21.817
I'm leaving.


33:22.197 --> 33:24.713
Who wants to stop me?


33:42.937 --> 33:44.441
All set?!


33:44.442 --> 33:45.959
Yeah!


33:46.297 --> 33:48.297
Let's do this!


34:45.397 --> 34:47.582
God,
i hope this works.


35:01.969 --> 35:03.623
Go! Go! Go!


35:23.933 --> 35:27.568
When this is over,
i'm gonna have so much sex.


35:29.097 --> 35:30.886
But not with you.


35:31.297 --> 35:33.432
We better move.


36:39.578 --> 36:41.806
Henriksen, now!


38:37.297 --> 38:40.596
I better call in. Hell of a story
i won't be telling.


38:40.597 --> 38:42.671
So, what are you
gonna tell them?


38:42.672 --> 38:45.596
The least ridiculous lie i can come up
with in the next five minutes.


38:45.597 --> 38:48.496
Good luck with that. Not to pressure
you or anything,


38:48.497 --> 38:51.871
- But what are you planning to do about us?
- I'm gonna kill you.


38:52.497 --> 38:56.514
Sam and dean winchester were in the
chopper when it caught on fire.


38:56.515 --> 39:00.232
Nothing's left. Can't even identify them
with dental records.


39:01.919 --> 39:04.065
Rest in peace, guys.


39:14.697 --> 39:16.196
Now get out of here.


39:16.646 --> 39:17.997
Yeah.


39:34.897 --> 39:37.303
Oh. Hey, there.


39:37.304 --> 39:41.576
Excuse me. I'm looking for two boys.
They're brothers.


39:41.577 --> 39:44.696
One's really tall,
and one's really cute.


39:44.697 --> 39:46.855
What's your name,
sweetie?


39:48.011 --> 39:49.473
Lilith.


40:15.270 --> 40:17.190
Turn on the news.


40:19.698 --> 40:22.623
The community
is still reeling


40:22.624 --> 40:25.200
From the tragedy that happened
just a few hours ago.


40:25.201 --> 40:29.310
Authorities believe a gas main ruptured,
causing the massive explosion


40:29.311 --> 40:33.597
That ripped apart the police station
and claimed the lives of everyone inside.


40:33.598 --> 40:37.526
Among the deceased, at least
six police officers and staff,


40:37.527 --> 40:42.477
Including sheriff melvin dodd, deputy phil
amici, and secretary nancy fitzgerald,


40:42.478 --> 40:47.708
As well as three fbi agents, identified as
steven groves, calvin reidy, and victor henriksen.


40:47.709 --> 40:50.740
Two fugitives in custody were also killed.


40:50.741 --> 40:55.109
We'll continue to follow the story here
at the scene, but for now, back to you, jim.


41:02.500 --> 41:07.366
- Must have happened right after we left.
- Considering the size of the blast...


41:08.098 --> 41:10.497
... smart money's on lilith.


41:10.889 --> 41:13.635
- What's in these?
- Something that'll protect you,


41:13.636 --> 41:16.887
Throw lilith off your trail...
for the time being, at least.


41:16.888 --> 41:22.148
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me. Lilith killed everyone.


41:22.149 --> 41:26.597
She slaughtered your precious little
virgin, plus a half a dozen other people.


41:27.078 --> 41:30.105
So, after your big speech
about humanity and war,


41:30.106 --> 41:33.946
Turns out your plan
was the one with the body count.


41:34.424 --> 41:36.938
Do you know how to fight a battle?


41:36.939 --> 41:41.706
You strike fast, and you don't leave any survivors,
so no one can go running to tell the boss.


41:41.707 --> 41:45.123
So, next time... we go with my plan.


42:00.707 --> 42:05.123
