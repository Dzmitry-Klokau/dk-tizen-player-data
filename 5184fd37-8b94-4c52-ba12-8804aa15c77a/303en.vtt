WEBVTT

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.199
Look, dad's gone now.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.899
We have to carry out his legacy,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.399
And that means hunting down as many
evil sons of bitches as we possibly can.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.499
Did I die?

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.199
Did you sell your soul for me?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.200
How long do you get?

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.200
One year.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.500
You shouldn't have done that.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.700
I guess I got to save your ass
for a change.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What kind of blade
can kill a demon?

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.199
Yesterday, I would have
said there was no such thing.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.600
Who was that masked chick?

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.599
You ever run across a guy
named Gordon Walker?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.199
He is dangerous to everyone
and everything around him.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.199
This demon tells me
they have soldiers

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.999
to fight in this coming war

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.899
humans fighting on hell's side.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.899
I know about Sam's visions.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.199
I know everything,
and your brother's fair game.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.100
Aaah!

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.899
Gordon should be reaching for the soap
for the next few years, at least.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.500
Tell me who you are!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.899
You're a demon.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.699
I'm here

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.899
because I want to help you.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.299
What could you possibly...

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.300
I can help you
save your brother.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.325
<font color="#4096d1">Supernatural 3x03 Bad day at Black Rock
==ragbear.com==</font>

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.700
It's true.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.300
The devil's gate
was opened in Wyoming.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.400
Big...

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.500
St. Helens big.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.800
There's no solid fix
on how many demons got out,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.800
but it's in the hundreds...
an army.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.800
Sam Winchester was there,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.800
wasn't he?

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.499
Talked to a guy who knows guy
who knows Bobby Singer,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.099
and, yeah, looks like the
Winchesters were at ground zero

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.500
when the gate was popped.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.399
But singer said
they went in there to stop it.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.600
mnh-mnh.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.500
Bobby's edge ain't what it used to be.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.699
Sam could have him believing
anything by now.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.699
Listen, Gordon.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.199
As far as talk goes,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.800
Sam Winchester checks out.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.999
He's a hunter. That's all.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.800
That's all?

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.600
Kubrick...

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.100
I'm not even sure he's human.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
Think I'm crazy?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.399
I told you there was a war coming

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.500
six months ago.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.200
Take a look around.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.900
It's here.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.700
Now I'm telling you this boy
is a part of it.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.300
Track him down, Kubrick.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.300
You'll come to see it, too.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.200
Sam Winchester must die.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.399
Because demon, that's why.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.699
I mean, the second you find out
this ruby chick is a demon,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.999
You go for the holy water.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.199
- You don't chat.
- No one was chatting, Dean.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.099
Oh, yeah? Then why didn't
you send her ass back to hell?

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.899
Because... Because she said she
might be able to help us out.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.700
How?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.799
Oh, really, Sam? How?
How could she possibly help us?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.600
She told me she could help you, okay?

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.100
Help you out of the crossroads deal.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.699
What's wrong with you? She's lying.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.300
You got to know that, don't you?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.500
She knows what your weakness is.
It's me.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.900
What else did she say?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.700
- Dude?
- Nothing.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.700
Nothing, okay?!

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.199
Look, I'm not an idiot, Dean.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.800
I'm not talking about trusting her.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.700
I'm talking about using her.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.300
I mean, we're at war, right?

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.999
And we don't know Jack about the enemy.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.999
We don't know where they are.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.299
We don't know what they're doing.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.900
Hell, we don't even know what they want.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.199
Now, this Ruby girl

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.700
knows more than we will
ever find out on our own.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.399
Now, yes, it's a risk. I know that.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.700
But we need to take it.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.299
You're okay, right?
I mean, you're feeling okay?

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.100
Yes, I'm fine! Why are you
always asking me that?

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.800
It's not mine.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.800
Nope.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.499
Check the glove compartment.
It's dad's.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.499
- Dad's?
- Yes.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.900
I keep it charged in case
any of his old contacts call.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.000
Hello?

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.700
Yes, this is Edgar Casey.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.400
No, no, no, no. Don't... don't call the
police. I'll handle this myself.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.099
Thanks.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.100
You know, can you just...
can you just lock it back up for me?

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.700
Great.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.799
Uh, I... I don't have my...
my book in front of me.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.100
Do you... do you have
the address so I can...

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.700
Sure. Okay.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.900
Go ahead.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.999
Right.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.900
Thanks a lot.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.699
Dad ever tell you he kept a container
at a storage place?

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.500
- What?
- Outside of Buffalo.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.899
No way.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.699
Yeah.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.300
And someone just broke into it.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.800
So, you've got no hard evidence
on this Winchester guy?

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.200
You're just working off
Gordon's instincts.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.700
You ever hunt with Gordon?

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.700
No. I heard he's good.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.200
Good?

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.599
He's the best.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.700
Saved my ass more times
than I can count.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.600
So, if he says
Sam Winchester's dangerous,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.099
I believe him.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.800
He's gonna be covering his tracks.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.100
Won't be easy to find.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.399
Last I got puts him in Nebraska
three weeks back.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.700
Not exactly a fresh lead.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.599
He ain't invisible, creedie.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.400
Some hunter out there knows something.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.100
So we start calling our contacts.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.700
All we need is one break.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.100
Don't play with my Jesus.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.400
Man.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.600
What?

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.600
Just dad. You know, him and his secrets.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.399
We spent all this time with this guy,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.799
and it's like we barely even
know the man.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.000
Well, we're about to learn something.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.400
No demons allowed.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800
Blood.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.800
Check this out.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.400
Whoever broke in here got attacked.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.800
Dear, old dad.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.799
I got two sets of boot tracks.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.900
It looks like it was a two-man job.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.099
And our friend with the buckshot
in him...

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.800
It looks like he kept walking.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.399
So, what's the deal?

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.100
Dad would do work here or something?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.900
Living the high life, as usual.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.599
1995.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.800
No way!

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.200
That's my division championship
soccer trophy.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.300
I can't believe he kept this.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.500
It was the probably the closest
you ever came to being a boy.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.200
Oh, wow!

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.900
It's my first sawed-off.
I made it myself.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.000
Sixth grade.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.700
Holy crap.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.100
Look at this.
He had land mines...

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.800
Which they didn't take.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.000
Or the guns.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.400
Guess they knew what they were after ?

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.600
Hey, Dean, check this out.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.700
See these symbols?

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.100
He used binding magic.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.700
These are curse boxes.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.999
Curse boxes?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.699
They're supposed to keep
the evil mojo in, right?

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.699
Kind of like the pandora deal.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.700
Yeah, they're built to contain
the power of the cursed object.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.599
Dad's journal did mention
a whole bunch of stuff,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.099
You know, dangerous,
hexed items, fetishes.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.499
He never did say
where they ended up.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.199
Yeah.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.400
This must be his toxic-waste dump.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.000
One box is missing.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.900
Great.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.299
Well, maybe they didn't open it.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.499
Come on, man.
Let's open it.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.999
Shut up about the damn box!

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.499
Do you see what's happening here?

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.200
I'm literally bleeding to death.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.200
- I'm gonna open it.
- Grossman...

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.300
Look, what if this
is really worth something?

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.800
What, we should
just hand it over to her?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.700
We took all the risk.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800
Hell, Wayne,

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.200
you got shot,

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.600
and all for a lousy few hundred bucks.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.600
Now, we could make more selling
whatever it is ourselves.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.700
Huh?

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.399
Are you kidding me?

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.700
Are you kidding me?!

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.199
It's a rabbit's foot.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.300
It's a rabbit's foot, Grossman!

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.200
I'm gonna die for a damn rabbit's foot.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.700
Oh.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400
Hey, Foster.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.599
Hey, listen, guys,
not to be a drag or nothing,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.799
but it's 6:00 in the morning.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.699
- Right.
- Can't you guys keep it down?

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.300
No, we just got a situation here is all.
Sorry.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.000
What the hell happened to you?

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.600
A shotgun happened to me.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.999
- Hey, Grossman,
- Yeah?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.800
Under my sink, there's a medical kit.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.500
And get some water boiling.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.000
I used to be an army medic,
you know, in nam.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.700
So, I guess this is your lucky day.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.100
Connecticut.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.900
Last three digits 8-8-0.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.900
Yep. That's it.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.599
Should have blacked out their plates

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.000
Before they parked in front of
the security camera.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.700
Four kings.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.500
You see that?

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.900
Deal it up again.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.199
Royal flush.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.500
Grossman, that's the second
royal flush in eight hands.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.300
I can't lose.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.100
I mean, really,
I... I can't lose.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.000
I think this thing really works.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.800
You know what I'm saying?

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.300
I'll tell you one thing...
there's no way in hell

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.600
we are handing it over
to that stuck-up bitch.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.899
- Freeze! - Freeze!

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:22.699
Nobody move!

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.099
- Don't move.
- Don't move!

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.400
- What is it?
- Stop!

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.799
All right. Give us the box.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.399
Please tell me that you didn't...

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400
Oh, they did.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.500
You opened it?!

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.599
Are you guys cops?

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.699
- Huh?
- Are you guys cops?!

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.000
What was in the box?

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.400
Oh, was that it, huh?
It was, wasn't it?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
What is that thing?

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.000
Sorry.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.800
Dean...

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.400
I got it.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.600
No, you don't.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.800
Damn!

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.300
Whoa!

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.900
Sam!

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.900
That's a lucky break.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.100
Is that a rabbit's foot?

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.000
I think it is.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.400
Huh.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.100
I'm not finding anything on it
in dad's journal.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.499
- Dean, come on.
- What?

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.599
Hey, that was my gun
he was aiming at your head.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.999
and my gun don't jam,
so that was a lucky break.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Not to mention them taking themselves
out... also a lucky break.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.100
Here. Scratch one.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.200
Come on, Sam.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.400
Scratch and win.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Look, Dean, it's got to be
cursed somehow.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.900
Otherwise, dad wouldn't
have locked it up.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.500
$1,200.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.600
You just won $1,200.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.200
Whoo!

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.800
I don't know, man.
It doesn't seem that cursed to me.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.300
Grossman?

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.800
Grossman, get up.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.600
Hey...

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.300
Grossman, get up.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.200
Hey.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.600
Hey...

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.300
Grossman?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.200
Oh.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.000
Ahhh!

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.600
Oh, man.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.299
Now, look, Bobby, we didn't know.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.299
You touched it? Damn it, Sam.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.000
Well, dad never told us
about this thing.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.599
I mean, you knew about
a storage place in Black Rock?

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.099
His lockup? Yeah, I knew.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.200
Hell, I built those curse boxes for him.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.699
Listen, you have got a serious problem.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.300
That rabbit's foot ain't
no dime-store notion.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.200
It's real hoodoo... old-world stuff.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.700
Made by a Baton Rouge conjure
woman about 100 years ago.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.300
It's a hell of a luck charm.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.199
It's not a luck charm.
It's a curse.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.100
She made it to kill people, Sam.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.100
See,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.500
you touch it, you own it.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.400
You own it, sure, you get a run
of good luck to beat the devil.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.299
But...

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.800
you lose it, that luck turns.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.799
It turns so bad that
you're dead inside a week.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.199
So, I won't lose it, Bobby.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.699
Everybody loses it!

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.500
Well, then, how do we break the curse?

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.000
I don't know if you can.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.200
Let me look through my library
and make some calls.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.200
Just sit tight.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.100
Dude,

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.400
we're up 15 grand.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.499
Don't worry.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.099
Bobby will find a way to break it.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.900
Till then, I say we hit Vegas,
pull a little "Rain Man."

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:00.899
You can be Rain Man.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.300
We just lay low until
Bobby calls back, okay?

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.099
Hi. Uh, table for two, please.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.500
Congratulations!

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.699
Say that again?

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.100
You are the one millionth guest
of the Biggerson's restaurant family.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.200
Right. If you hear anything,
give me a call.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.700
Well, that clears my book.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.200
The word's out.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.800
Now we wait.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.300
Now we eat.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.700
Good idea.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.899
What do you like?
I got canned everything.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.600
No, no, man.
Not eating in the r.v.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.200
Look, I know a good place.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.600
Wide menu, good service,
homey atmosphere...

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Garlic knots.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.700
The menu's on their website.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.700
Bobby's right.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.700
This lore goes way back.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.100
Pure hoodoo.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.100
You can't just cut one off any rabbit.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.800
It has to be in a cemetery

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.600
under a full moon on a friday the 13th.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.900
I think from now on,

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.300
we only go to places with Biggerson's.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.800
Can I freshen you up?

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.400
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:20.800
Thanks.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.900
- Oh.
- Oh.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.200
Oh, I... No, don't worry.
That's okay. That's... I got it.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.600
It's no trouble, really.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:30.800
Okay.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.100
Sorry about that.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.400
It's all right.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.800
Dude,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.900
if you were ever gonna get lucky...

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.700
Chill out.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.100
Oh! Oh, jeez!

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.500
Sorry.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.500
How was that good?

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.000
Son of a bitch.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.700
Come on.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.900
Whoa!

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.200
Wow.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.300
You suck.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.900
So, what, now your luck turns bad?

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.300
I guess.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.600
I wonder how bad.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.299
Looks good.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.600
I like that when they drop
the whole onion in the fryer.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.400
Nearest location...

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.700
You seeing that?

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.400
Yes, I am.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.300
Adios compadre.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.300
Oh, man.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.200
What do you want?

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.500
Heard about your friend.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.900
It's bad luck.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.700
Piss off.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.000
We know someone hired you
to steal the rabbit's foot...

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.800
A woman.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.900
Yeah?

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.900
How do you know that?

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.100
Because she just stole it back from us.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.500
Listen, man, this is...

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.300
Sam, you okay?

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.300
Yeah. I'm good.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.700
I want you to tell us her name.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.900
Screw you.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.800
It wasn't a freak accident
that killed your partner.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.300
What?

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.800
It was the rabbit's foot.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.300
You're crazy, man.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.400
You know I'm not.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.599
You saw what happened, what it did...

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.400
All the flukes, all the luck.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.100
When you lose the foot,
that luck goes sour.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.000
That's what killed your friend.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.600
And my brother here is next,

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.300
and who knows how many more
innocent people after that.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.499
Now, if you don't help us
stop this thing,

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.400
then that puts those deaths
on your head.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.900
Now, I can read people...

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.800
and I get it.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.099
You're a thief and a scumbag.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.000
That's fine.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.800
But you're not a killer...

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.500
Are you?

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.200
No one saw which way they went,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.600
and their meal was free,
so there's no credit-card trail.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.999
Don't worry. We'll find them.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.500
What makes you so sure?

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.500
'cause there's a higher power
at work here.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.300
I know it now.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.106
Hello.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.500
Dean, great news.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.899
Wasn't easy, but I found a heavyweight
cleansing ritual that should do the trick.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.900
Bobby, that's, uh, great,
except Sam, uh...

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.199
...Sam lost the foot.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.300
He what?

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.199
Bobby, listen, listen.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.399
This hot chick stole it from him.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.600
I'm serious.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.899
In her mid-20s, and she was sharp,
you know?

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.600
Good enough of a con to play us.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.899
And she only gave the guys
she hired a name...

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.399
Probably an alias or something.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.900
Luigi or something.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.299
Lugosi.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.300
Lugosi?

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.500
Lugosi.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.500
Oh, crap. It's probably Bela.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.999
Bela Lugosi? That's cute.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.800
Bela Talbot's her real name.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.900
Crossed paths with her once or twice.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.699
She knew about the rabbit's foot.
Is she a hunter?

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.499
Pretty friggin' far from a hunter,

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.400
but she knows her way
around the territory.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.699
She's been out of the country.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.000
Last I heard, she was
in the middle east someplace.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.500
I guess she's back.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.300
Which means seriously bad luck for you.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.400
Great.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.500
But if it is Bela,

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.600
at least I might know some folks
who know where to find her.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.200
Thanks, Bobby, again.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.700
Just look out for your brother,
you idjit.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.800
What?

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.600
I lost my shoe.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.300
All right, Bobby, thanks.
Hey, we owe you...another one.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.899
All right, Bobby's got it
on pretty good authority

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.500
that this Bela chick lives in Queens.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.900
So it will take me about two hours
to get there.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.300
So, what are we doing then?

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.199
You, my brother, are staying here,

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.200
'cause I don't want
your bad luck getting us killed.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.299
What am I even supposed to do, Dean?

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.900
Nothing. Nothing. Come here.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.099
I don't want you doing anything.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.500
I want you to sit right here

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.500
and don't move, okay?

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.800
Don't turn on the light.
Don't turn off the light.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.600
Don't even scratch your nose.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.400
Because you shook on 1.5.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.800
Well, maybe I should just take it
somewhere else.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.400
Don't threaten me, Luke.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.400
Despite your reputation,
you don't scare me.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.200
Well, I'm glad you see it that way.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.300
I'll see you at the airstrip in an hour.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.100
???

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.300
Oh, come on. I...

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.400
I didn't...

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.500
Ah!

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.600
You're gonna give it back.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.100
Sweetie,

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.400
no, I'm not.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800
Yeah? We'll see.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.900
Bela, right?

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.200
That's right...

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:11.800
Dean.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.400
You know the thing's cursed,
don't you?

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.599
You'd be surprised what some people
would pay for something like that.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.300
Really?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.900
There's a lucrative market out there.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.000
A lot of money to be made.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.299
You hunters, with all those amulets
and talismans you use

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.900
to stop those big, bad monsters...

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.099
Any one of them could put your
children's children through college.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.500
So, you know the truth

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.899
about what's really going on out there,

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.900
and this is what you decide
to do with it?

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.300
You become a thief.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.300
I procure unique items
for a select clientele.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.300
Yeah.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.399
A thief.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:53.700
No.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.400
A great thief.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.200
Oh, he's awake.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.100
Back with us, eh?

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.899
We didn't even have to touch you.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.900
???
and knocked yourself out.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.000
It was like watching Jerry Lewis
trying to stack chairs.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.500
Who are you?

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.200
What do you want...

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.800
I used to think your friend Gordon
sent me...

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.299
Gordon?

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.199
Oh, come on.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.400
...because he asked me to track you down

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.800
and put a bullet in your brain.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.100
Great. That sounds like him.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.800
But

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.700
as it turns out...

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.900
I'm on a mission from God.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.500
Look, Bela.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.800
My brother, he... touched the foot.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.799
And when you took it from him,
his luck went from...

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.400
I know how it works.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.000
So, then you know he's gonna die
unless we can destroy it.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.200
Oh.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.600
You can have the foot...

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.100
For $1.5 million.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.000
Nice.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.900
Yeah. I'll just call my banker.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.300
How'd you even find the damn thing,

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.399
stuck in the back of some storage place,

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.400
middle of nowhere?

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.200
I just asked a few of the ghosts
of the people it had killed.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.900
They were very tuned in to its location.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.599
So you're only after yourself, huh?

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.900
It's all about number one.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.500
Being a hunter is so much more noble?

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.099
A bunch of obsessed,
revenge-driven sociopaths

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.100
trying to save a world
that can't be saved.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.800
Well, aren't you
a glass half full.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.000
We're all going to hell, Dean.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.299
Might as well enjoy the ride.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.900
I actually agree with you there.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.400
Anyhoo, this has been charming,
but, uh, look at the time.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.600
Oh, and...

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:49.600
This.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.099
You're not the only one
with sticky fingers.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.500
If it's any consolation, I think
you're a truly awful person.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.199
You were a part of that demon plan
to open the gate, weren't you?

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.499
We did everything we could to stop it.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.000
Lie, lie, lie!

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.100
You were in on it.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.199
You know what they're next move
is, too, don't you?

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.000
No, I don't, okay?
You're wrong about all of this.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.800
Where are they gonna hit us next?

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.800
Where?!

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.800
Gordon told me about you, Sam,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.600
about your powers.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.399
You're some kind of
weirdo psychic freak.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.399
No, not anymore.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.399
I have no powers, no visions... nothing.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.900
- It just...
- Lie!

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.900
Now no more lies.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.099
There's an army of demons out there,

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.400
pushing at a world already on the brink.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.000
we're on deck
for the end game here, right?

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.600
So maybe,

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.000
just maybe you can understand

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.299
why we can't take chances.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.399
Whoa! Okay, okay.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.999
- Now, hold on a minute.
- Kubrick, get...

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.200
No! You saw what happened, Creedie.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.600
Ask yourself...

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.500
Why are we here?

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.100
Because you saw a picture on the web?

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.300
Because we chose this motel
instead of another?

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.999
Luck like that doesn't just happen.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.199
Look, I can explain all of that.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.400
Shut up.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.300
It's God, Creedie.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.300
He led us here for one reason...

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.100
To do his work.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.700
This is destiny.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.600
Whoa.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:51.800
No.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.500
No destiny.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.900
Just a rabbit's foot.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.099
Put the gun down, son,

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.300
or you're gonna be
scraping brain off the wall.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.700
Oh, this thing?

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Yeah, that thing.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.200
Okay.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.300
But, you see, there's something
about me that you don't know.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.700
Yeah? What would that be?

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.200
It's my lucky day.

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.200
Oh, my God!
Did you see that shot?!

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.900
I'm amazing.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:33.900
I'm Batman.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.600
Yeah.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.800
You're Batman.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.700
All right.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.200
Bone ash,

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.800
cayenne pepper.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.000
That should do it.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.100
One second.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:52.899
Dean...

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.400
Hey, back off, jinx.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.100
I'm bringing home the bacon.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.100
All right.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.900
Say goodbye to "Wascawy Wabbit."

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.400
I think you'll find that belongs to me.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.200
Or, you know...

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.000
Whatever.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.900
Put the foot down, honey.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.700
No.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.700
You're not gonna shoot anybody.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.400
See, I happen to be able to read people.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.400
Okay, you're a thief. fine.
But you're not...

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.600
Oh!

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:35.999
Son of a...

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.900
Back off, tiger.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.800
Back off.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.200
You make one more move,
and I'll pull the trigger.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.800
You've got the luck, Dean.
You I can't hit.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800
But your brother...

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.800
Him I can't miss.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.800
What the hell is wrong with you?!

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.099
You don't just do around
shooting people like that!

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.100
Relax.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.100
It's a shoulder hit. I can aim.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.200
Besides,

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.500
who here hasn't shot a few people?

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.999
Put the rabbit's foot on the ground now.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.900
All right!

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.000
All right.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.500
Take it easy.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.500
Think fast.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.500
Damn.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:28.600
Now,

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.100
what do you say we destroy
that ugly-ass piece of dead thing?

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.100
Thanks very much.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.299
I'm out $1.5 million

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.700
and on the bad side of a very powerful,
fairly psychotic buyer.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.800
Wow.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.899
I really don't feel bad about that.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:51.800
Sam?

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:52.700
No.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.500
Not even a little.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.100
Maybe next time,

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.400
I'll hang you out to dry.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.500
Oh, don't go away angry. Just go away.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.500
Have a nice night, boys.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.800
You good?

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.400
I'll live.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.800
I guess we're back to normal now, huh?

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.599
No good luck.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.900
No bad luck.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.700
Oh,

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.199
I forgot. We're at $46,000.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.200
I almost forgot about the...

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.500
scratch tickets.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.400
Son of a bitch!

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.400
You were right about everything.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.900
Sam Winchester is more than a monster.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.500
He's the adversary.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.700
And what was it that convinced you?

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.600
God led me to him...

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.800
And his will is clear.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.300
Okay.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.900
That's great.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.200
I'm glad to have you on board.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.600
But, uh, first things first.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.600
We got to get me the hell out of here.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.200
'cause like i told you before,

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.199
Sam Winchester must die.
