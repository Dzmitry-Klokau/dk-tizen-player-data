there is something really...


10:18.430 --> 10:19.990
wrong with her.


10:24.560 --> 10:29.490
i'm not sure that katie is...katie.


10:29.530 --> 10:31.230

12:56.460 --> 12:58.160

i see.


16:20.430 --> 16:21.890
now,how exactly did he --


16:21.930 --> 16:24.290
he was just inside changing a light bulb.


16:24.330 --> 16:25.890
must have lost his balance.


16:25.930 --> 16:28.830
-were you here when this happened?
-no. i was out.


16:28.860 --> 16:31.290
uh,the only one here was our daughter,dakota.


16:31.330 --> 16:33.130
okay.


16:54.430 --> 16:56.560
okay. well,uh,i think that's all i need.


16:56.590 --> 16:58.160
i'll get out of your way now.


16:58.190 --> 16:59.730
thank you.


17:26.690 --> 17:28.560

17:30.330 --> 17:31.460

17:31.490 --> 17:34.990

17:46.630 --> 17:48.930

17:48.960 --> 17:53.260

17:53.290 --> 17:56.360

17:56.390 --> 17:59.190

18:08.960 --> 18:12.230

18:13.630 --> 18:15.230
let me in!


18:15.260 --> 18:16.890

18:16.930 --> 18:18.690
give mommy a minute.


18:33.590 --> 18:35.890
aren't you just the cutest thing?


18:37.830 --> 18:41.060
oh,thank you.


18:41.090 --> 18:44.390
uh,katie,could you put
these in the kitchen,please?


18:49.030 --> 18:50.360
katie seems okay, considering


18:50.390 --> 18:51.830
she's fine. yeah.um,look,i'm


18:51.860 --> 18:54.690
and you -- how are you doing really?


18:54.730 --> 18:56.260
i'm fine. look,we're fine.


18:56.290 --> 18:57.890
um,this isn't a good time


18:57.930 --> 19:00.560
i wasn't sure if you were
keeping the house or selling.


19:00.590 --> 19:02.060
we at cicero realty would like


19:02.090 --> 19:04.090
look,i told you it's not a good time!


19:11.160 --> 19:12.590
i want ice cream.


19:12.630 --> 19:15.630
mommy,ice cream,please.


19:36.630 --> 19:37.790
hey,ben.


19:38.860 --> 19:41.190
hey.  you were at my party.


19:41.230 --> 19:43.090
yeah. yeah,i'm dean.


19:52.930 --> 19:54.990
everything okay? something wrong?


20:03.030 --> 20:04.790
is that your game they're playing with?


20:04.830 --> 20:08.330
ryan humphrey borrowed it,
and now he won't give it back.


20:08.360 --> 20:10.660
-well,you want me to go...
-no! don't go over there!


20:10.690 --> 20:12.460
only bitches send a grown-up.


20:14.830 --> 20:16.130
you're not wrong.


20:16.160 --> 20:17.790
and i'm not a bitch.


20:22.760 --> 20:24.460
is that humphrey?


20:24.490 --> 20:27.190
the one that needs to lay off the burgers?


20:46.630 --> 20:49.360
ryan.


20:53.290 --> 20:54.860
i'd like my game back, please.


20:54.890 --> 20:57.290
fine. take it back.


21:06.560 --> 21:08.190
see? told you guys he was a


21:16.590 --> 21:18.150
thanks


21:20.590 --> 21:22.260
dude,that was awesome!


21:22.290 --> 21:26.290
benjamin isaac braeden... what's gotten into you?


21:26.330 --> 21:27.490
he stole my game.


21:27.530 --> 21:29.330
so you kick him? since when is...


21:31.960 --> 21:34.590
did you tell my son to beat up that kid?


21:34.630 --> 21:38.260
what? somebody had to teach him
how to kick the bully in the nads


21:38.290 --> 21:41.760
-who asked you to teach him anything?
-just relax.


21:41.790 --> 21:43.160
what are you even still doing here?


21:43.190 --> 21:45.630
we had one weekend
together a million years ago.


21:45.660 --> 21:48.390
you don't know me. you have
no business with my son.


21:48.430 --> 21:49.590
lisa.


21:49.630 --> 21:51.430
just leave us alone.


21:55.490 --> 21:56.930
ben!


22:00.030 --> 22:01.430
thanks.


22:25.160 --> 22:28.630
i love you most in the
whole wide world,mommy.


22:28.660 --> 22:31.160
um,me,too,sweetie.


22:31.190 --> 22:32.960
come on,hold still.


22:45.430 --> 22:47.330
what's wrong,mommy?


22:48.590 --> 22:51.160
nothing,sweetie.


22:53.190 --> 22:54.630
are we going for ice cream now?


22:54.660 --> 22:58.290
yeah, we're going for ice cream.


25:01.260 --> 25:02.960
can i have the ice cream now?


25:21.510 --> 25:23.480
kids in this town.


25:23.510 --> 25:24.980
yeah. tell me about it.


25:26.710 --> 25:29.780
so,what do you know about changelings?


25:29.810 --> 25:30.940
evil monster babies?


25:30.980 --> 25:33.040
no,not necessarily babies.


25:33.080 --> 25:35.110
they're kids...


25:35.140 --> 25:37.340
creepy,"stare at you like you're lunch" kids.


25:37.380 --> 25:39.410
yeah.


25:39.440 --> 25:42.340
there's one at every victim's house.


25:44.980 --> 25:47.510
so,changelings can perfectly mimic children.


25:47.540 --> 25:50.810
according to lore,they climb in
the window,snatch the kid.


25:50.840 --> 25:52.340
there were marks on the windowsill


25:52.380 --> 25:53.540
at one of the kid's houses.


25:53.580 --> 25:54.780
looked to me like blood.


25:54.810 --> 25:56.710
the changeling grabs a kid,
assumes its form,


25:56.740 --> 25:58.980
joins the happy fam just for kicks?


25:59.010 --> 26:01.210
not quite.


26:01.240 --> 26:03.240
changelings feed on the mom...


26:03.280 --> 26:05.410
synovial fluid.


26:05.440 --> 26:09.180
the moms have these odd bruises on the back of their necks.


26:14.480 --> 26:16.150
changelings can drain them for a few weeks


26:16.240 --> 26:17.440
before mom finally croaks.


26:17.480 --> 26:19.710
and then there's dad and the babysitter


26:19.740 --> 26:23.240
yeah. seems like anyone who gets
between the changeling's food source ends up dead.


26:23.280 --> 26:25.080
and fire's the only way to waste them?


26:25.110 --> 26:27.910
great. we'll just bust in, drag the kids out,


26:27.940 --> 26:29.010
torch them on the front lawn.


26:29.040 --> 26:31.040
that will play great with the neighbors.


26:31.080 --> 26:33.740
what about the real ones?
what happens to them?


26:33.780 --> 26:35.380
they stash them underground somewhere.


26:35.410 --> 26:37.180
i don't know why, but if it's true,


26:37.210 --> 26:38.910
the real kids might be out there.


26:38.940 --> 26:40.780
we better start looking.


26:40.810 --> 26:44.480
so,any kid in the neighborhood is vulnerable?


26:44.510 --> 26:46.380
-yep. -we got to make a stop.


26:46.410 --> 26:47.740
i want to check on someone.


26:47.780 --> 26:50.240
if the real kids are still alive,
we don't have time


26:50.280 --> 26:51.910
we have to.


26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
dean


26:59.960 --> 26:59.990
i was thinking... ben's birthday.


27:00.700 --> 27:01.740
i didn't bring him a present.


27:01.770 --> 27:03.000
that's okay.


27:03.040 --> 27:06.070
no. no. no. i feel terrible,so,uh...


27:06.100 --> 27:07.100
here.


27:07.140 --> 27:08.870
take a long weekend --


27:08.900 --> 27:10.300
just the two of you -- on me.


27:10.340 --> 27:11.500
what?


27:11.540 --> 27:13.700
I hear six flags is great this time of year.


27:13.740 --> 27:15.070
Go now. avoid the traffic.


27:15.100 --> 27:17.740
"Siegfried Houdini."


27:17.770 --> 27:18.840
Whose card is this?


27:18.870 --> 27:19.870
Mine.


27:21.470 --> 27:23.070
Never mind. it'll work.


27:23.100 --> 27:24.070
I promise.


27:25.370 --> 27:26.470
You should leave.


27:26.500 --> 27:27.370
Lisa...


27:27.400 --> 27:29.070
Mommy,what's wrong?


27:29.100 --> 27:30.900
Nothing,Ben. It's cool.


27:30.940 --> 27:34.240
Make him go away,mommy.


27:38.600 --> 27:39.900
You heard him.


27:41.070 --> 27:42.040
Get out.


27:42.070 --> 27:44.300
Lisa...


27:44.340 --> 27:45.870
I don't think this is a good idea.


27:45.900 --> 27:47.570
Get out!


28:35.570 --> 28:37.570
They took ben he's changed.


28:37.600 --> 28:39.200
What?! Are you sure?


28:39.240 --> 28:41.300
Yeah,i'm sure. I checked his windowsill.


28:41.340 --> 28:42.370
Blood?


28:42.400 --> 28:43.770
I don't think it is blood,


28:43.800 --> 28:45.870
And i think i know where the kids are.


29:01.100 --> 29:02.540
Red dirt.


29:02.570 --> 29:04.370
That's what was on the window.


29:04.400 --> 29:05.540
You take the front.


29:05.570 --> 29:07.500
I'll go around.


30:30.000 --> 30:32.140
ben..ben...it's okay.


30:32.170 --> 30:33.570
I'm gonna get you out of here.


30:37.000 --> 30:38.770
What do you think you're doing?


30:55.000 --> 30:57.870
This is private property.


30:59.200 --> 31:02.070
I'm calling the police.


31:12.270 --> 31:13.430
You heard me! Get out!


31:13.470 --> 31:15.070
Let me get my bag. I'm going.


31:15.100 --> 31:16.400
I don't mean to cause any trouble.


31:20.140 --> 31:22.100
Mommy?


31:22.140 --> 31:24.140
ben.. Play with me.


31:24.170 --> 31:26.500
This isn't funny anymore.
I put you to bed three times.


31:26.540 --> 31:29.670
I don't want to go to bed.


31:29.700 --> 31:31.100
I want to be with you,mommy.


31:31.140 --> 31:32.240
That's sweet,hon.


31:36.400 --> 31:37.270
Come on.


31:38.470 --> 31:39.440
Let's go.


31:43.070 --> 31:44.100
All right,come on.


31:44.140 --> 31:45.370
I'm hungry.


31:45.400 --> 31:46.740
Mini pizzas okay?


31:46.770 --> 31:48.170
Deluxe is all we've got.


31:48.200 --> 31:49.440
Okay.


31:49.470 --> 31:51.800
That's funny --
I thought we were anti-olives this month.


32:03.400 --> 32:05.710
it's ok. get out here ok?


32:12.100 --> 32:13.470
Come on,girls! Come on!


32:17.200 --> 32:18.840
Everybody back! Everybody back!


32:20.740 --> 32:21.840
Cover your eyes!


32:26.370 --> 32:28.740
Here. Use this.


32:30.670 --> 32:31.670
All right.


32:31.700 --> 32:33.370
All right,ben. Come on.


32:33.400 --> 32:34.400
Him first.


32:34.440 --> 32:36.640
Hey! Dean! There's a mother.


32:36.670 --> 32:37.700
A mother changeling?


32:37.740 --> 32:39.340
We got to get these kids out quick.


32:39.370 --> 32:41.240
Right there. There's one more.


32:41.270 --> 32:43.200
You got to break the lock!


32:43.240 --> 32:44.770
I guess that's why the changelings


32:44.800 --> 32:47.340
are keeping the kids alive
--so the mom can snack on them.


32:54.470 --> 32:55.840
What's wrong,mommy?


32:55.870 --> 32:57.370
You're not my son.


32:57.400 --> 32:59.070
Yes,i am. Where's ben?


32:59.100 --> 33:00.940
I'm ben.


33:00.970 --> 33:02.200
I love you,mommy.


33:15.770 --> 33:18.170
They don't want you to leave me,mommy.


33:21.870 --> 33:24.570
Mommy? Mommy?


33:28.400 --> 33:30.570
Let me in!


33:30.600 --> 33:32.270
What are you doing?!


33:32.300 --> 33:33.840
Let me in!


33:33.870 --> 33:36.740
Let me in! Let me in! let me in!


34:00.670 --> 34:02.600
ben,get them out of here!


34:54.970 --> 34:56.700
ben?!


34:58.470 --> 35:00.200
ben!


35:00.570 --> 35:02.500
baby,are you okay?


35:03.950 --> 35:05.420
i'm okay,mom.


35:05.450 --> 35:06.420
oh,my god.


35:11.690 --> 35:12.820
what the hell just happened?


35:12.850 --> 35:14.920
i'll explain everything if you want me to,


35:14.950 --> 35:16.690
but,trust me, you probably don't.


35:16.720 --> 35:20.150
the important thing is that ben's safe.


35:20.190 --> 35:21.920
thank you.


35:24.520 --> 35:25.690
thank you.


35:29.190 --> 35:30.820
i'm gonna give you guys some time.


35:32.250 --> 35:33.290
come on.


35:42.350 --> 35:43.450
changelings?


35:45.550 --> 35:47.720
you know how i never mentioned my job?


35:47.750 --> 35:49.320
this is my job.


35:49.350 --> 35:51.390
i so didn't want to know that.


35:53.750 --> 35:55.320
do you think he'll be okay?


35:55.350 --> 35:57.450
yeah. i think he'll be fine.


35:57.490 --> 35:59.620
okay. seriously...


35:59.650 --> 36:02.550
i mean,you're 100%
sure that he is not mine,right?


36:02.590 --> 36:03.690
you're off the hook.


36:03.720 --> 36:05.490
i did a blood test when he was a baby.


36:06.750 --> 36:09.650
there was this guy some
bar back in a biker joint.


36:10.890 --> 36:13.050
what? i had a type.


36:13.090 --> 36:16.190
leather jacket,couple of scars,
no mailing address


36:16.220 --> 36:17.220
i was there.


36:17.250 --> 36:19.850
guess i was a little wild back then...


36:21.390 --> 36:23.350
...before i became a mom.


36:24.590 --> 36:26.520
so,yeah. you can relax.


36:28.150 --> 36:30.090
good.


36:37.250 --> 36:38.790
i...


36:38.820 --> 36:40.620
i swear you look disappointed.


36:45.550 --> 36:47.550
yeah,i don't know.


36:47.590 --> 36:50.050
it's weird,you know your life.


36:50.090 --> 36:52.450
i mean,this house and kid.


36:52.490 --> 36:53.790
it's not my life...


36:53.820 --> 36:55.790
never will be.


36:55.820 --> 36:59.520
some stuff happened to me recently,and,uh...


37:02.290 --> 37:04.650
anyway,a guy in my situation --


37:04.690 --> 37:06.090
you start to think, you know.


37:06.120 --> 37:07.490
i'm gonna be gone one day,


37:07.520 --> 37:10.990
and what am i leaving behind besides a car?


37:11.020 --> 37:13.350
i don't know.


37:13.390 --> 37:14.820
ben may not be your kid,


37:14.850 --> 37:18.590
but he wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you.


37:20.150 --> 37:21.820
that's a lot if you ask me.


37:30.590 --> 37:33.620
you know, just for the record...

41:04.820 --> 41:06.920
not all demons are the same,sam.


41:06.950 --> 41:09.720
not all of us want the same thing.


41:09.750 --> 41:13.190
me?
i want to help you from time to time.


41:13.220 --> 41:14.320
that's all.


41:17.890 --> 41:22.790
and if you let me,
there's something in it for you.


41:22.820 --> 41:24.390

41:24.420 --> 41:26.550
i could help you save your brother.
