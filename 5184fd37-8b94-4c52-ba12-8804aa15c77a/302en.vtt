there is something really...


10:17.130 --> 10:18.690
wrong with her.


10:23.260 --> 10:28.190

i see.


16:16.130 --> 16:17.590
now,how exactly did he --


16:17.630 --> 16:19.990
he was just inside changing a light bulb.


16:20.030 --> 16:21.590
must have lost his balance.


16:21.630 --> 16:24.530
-were you here when this happened?
-no. i was out.


16:24.560 --> 16:26.990
uh,the only one here was our daughter,dakota.


16:27.030 --> 16:28.830
okay.


16:50.130 --> 16:52.260
okay. well,uh,i think that's all i need.


16:52.290 --> 16:53.860
i'll get out of your way now.


16:53.890 --> 16:55.430
thank you.


17:22.390 --> 17:24.260

17:26.030 --> 17:27.160

17:27.190 --> 17:30.690

17:42.330 --> 17:44.630

17:44.660 --> 17:48.960

17:48.990 --> 17:52.060

17:52.090 --> 17:54.890

18:04.660 --> 18:07.930

18:09.330 --> 18:10.930
let me in!


18:10.960 --> 18:12.590

18:12.630 --> 18:14.390
give mommy a minute.


18:29.290 --> 18:31.590
aren't you just the cutest thing?


18:33.530 --> 18:36.760
oh,thank you.


18:36.790 --> 18:40.090
uh,katie,could you put
these in the kitchen,please?


18:44.730 --> 18:46.060
katie seems okay, considering


18:46.090 --> 18:47.530
she's fine. yeah.um,look,i'm


18:47.560 --> 18:50.390
and you -- how are you doing really?


18:50.430 --> 18:51.960
i'm fine. look,we're fine.


18:51.990 --> 18:53.590
um,this isn't a good time


18:53.630 --> 18:56.260
i wasn't sure if you were
keeping the house or selling.


18:56.290 --> 18:57.760
we at cicero realty would like


18:57.790 --> 18:59.790
look,i told you it's not a good time!


19:06.860 --> 19:08.290
i want ice cream.


19:08.330 --> 19:11.330
mommy,ice cream,please.


19:32.330 --> 19:33.490
hey,ben.


19:34.560 --> 19:36.890
hey.  you were at my party.


19:36.930 --> 19:38.790
yeah. yeah,i'm dean.


19:48.630 --> 19:50.690
everything okay? something wrong?


19:58.730 --> 20:00.490
is that your game they're playing with?


20:00.530 --> 20:04.030
ryan humphrey borrowed it,
and now he won't give it back.


20:04.060 --> 20:06.360
-well,you want me to go...
-no! don't go over there!


20:06.390 --> 20:08.160
only bitches send a grown-up.


20:10.530 --> 20:11.830
you're not wrong.


20:11.860 --> 20:13.490
and i'm not a bitch.


20:18.460 --> 20:20.160
is that humphrey?


20:20.190 --> 20:22.890
the one that needs to lay off the burgers?


20:42.330 --> 20:45.060
ryan.


20:48.990 --> 20:50.560
i'd like my game back, please.


20:50.590 --> 20:52.990
fine. take it back.


21:02.260 --> 21:03.890
see? told you guys he was a


21:12.290 --> 21:13.850
thanks


21:16.290 --> 21:17.960
dude,that was awesome!


21:17.990 --> 21:21.990
benjamin isaac braeden... what's gotten into you?


21:22.030 --> 21:23.190
he stole my game.


21:23.230 --> 21:25.030
so you kick him? since when is...


21:27.660 --> 21:30.290
did you tell my son to beat up that kid?


21:30.330 --> 21:33.960
what? somebody had to teach him
how to kick the bully in the nads


21:33.990 --> 21:37.460
-who asked you to teach him anything?
-just relax.


21:37.490 --> 21:38.860
what are you even still doing here?


21:38.890 --> 21:41.330
we had one weekend
together a million years ago.


21:41.360 --> 21:44.090
you don't know me. you have
no business with my son.


21:44.130 --> 21:45.290
lisa.


21:45.330 --> 21:47.130
just leave us alone.


21:51.190 --> 21:52.630
ben!


21:55.730 --> 21:57.130
thanks.


22:20.860 --> 22:24.330
i love you most in the
whole wide world,mommy.


22:24.360 --> 22:26.860
um,me,too,sweetie.


22:26.890 --> 22:28.660
come on,hold still.


22:41.130 --> 22:43.030
what's wrong,mommy?


22:44.290 --> 22:46.860
nothing,sweetie.


22:48.890 --> 22:50.330
are we going for ice cream now?


22:50.360 --> 22:53.990
yeah, we're going for ice cream.


24:56.960 --> 24:58.660
can i have the ice cream now?


25:14.060 --> 25:16.030
kids in this town.


25:16.060 --> 25:17.530
yeah. tell me about it.


25:19.260 --> 25:22.330
so,what do you know about changelings?


25:22.360 --> 25:23.490
evil monster babies?


25:23.530 --> 25:25.590
no,not necessarily babies.


25:25.630 --> 25:27.660
they're kids...


25:27.690 --> 25:29.890
creepy,"stare at you like you're lunch" kids.


25:29.930 --> 25:31.960
yeah.


25:31.990 --> 25:34.890
there's one at every victim's house.


25:37.530 --> 25:40.060
so,changelings can perfectly mimic children.


25:40.090 --> 25:43.360
according to lore,they climb in
the window,snatch the kid.


25:43.390 --> 25:44.890
there were marks on the windowsill


25:44.930 --> 25:46.090
at one of the kid's houses.


25:46.130 --> 25:47.330
looked to me like blood.


25:47.360 --> 25:49.260
the changeling grabs a kid,
assumes its form,


25:49.290 --> 25:51.530
joins the happy fam just for kicks?


25:51.560 --> 25:53.760
not quite.


25:53.790 --> 25:55.790
changelings feed on the mom...


25:55.830 --> 25:57.960
synovial fluid.


25:57.990 --> 26:01.730
the moms have these odd bruises on the back of their necks.


26:06.030 --> 26:07.700
changelings can drain them for a few weeks


26:07.790 --> 26:08.990
before mom finally croaks.


26:09.030 --> 26:11.260
and then there's dad and the babysitter


26:11.290 --> 26:14.790
yeah. seems like anyone who gets
between the changeling's food source ends up dead.


26:14.830 --> 26:16.630
and fire's the only way to waste them?


26:16.660 --> 26:19.460
great. we'll just bust in, drag the kids out,


26:19.490 --> 26:20.560
torch them on the front lawn.


26:20.590 --> 26:22.590
that will play great with the neighbors.


26:22.630 --> 26:25.290
what about the real ones?
what happens to them?


26:25.330 --> 26:26.930
they stash them underground somewhere.


26:26.960 --> 26:28.730
i don't know why, but if it's true,


26:28.760 --> 26:30.460
the real kids might be out there.


26:30.490 --> 26:32.330
we better start looking.


26:32.360 --> 26:36.030
so,any kid in the neighborhood is vulnerable?


26:36.060 --> 26:37.930
-yep. -we got to make a stop.


26:37.960 --> 26:39.290
i want to check on someone.


26:39.330 --> 26:41.790
if the real kids are still alive,
we don't have time


26:41.830 --> 26:43.460
we have to.


26:46.930 --> 26:47.960
dean


26:47.990 --> 26:50.260
i was thinking... ben's birthday.


26:50.290 --> 26:51.330
i didn't bring him a present.


26:51.360 --> 26:52.590
that's okay.


26:52.630 --> 26:55.660
no. no. no. i feel terrible,so,uh...


26:55.690 --> 26:56.690
here.


26:56.730 --> 26:58.460
take a long weekend --


26:58.490 --> 26:59.890
just the two of you -- on me.


26:59.930 --> 27:01.090
what?


27:01.130 --> 27:03.290
I hear six flags is great this time of year.


27:03.330 --> 27:04.660
Go now. avoid the traffic.


27:04.690 --> 27:07.330
"Siegfried Houdini."


27:07.360 --> 27:08.430
Whose card is this?


27:08.460 --> 27:09.460
Mine.


27:11.060 --> 27:12.660
Never mind. it'll work.


27:12.690 --> 27:13.660
I promise.


27:14.960 --> 27:16.060
You should leave.


27:16.090 --> 27:16.960
Lisa...


27:16.990 --> 27:18.660
Mommy,what's wrong?


27:18.690 --> 27:20.490
Nothing,Ben. It's cool.


27:20.530 --> 27:23.830
Make him go away,mommy.


27:28.190 --> 27:29.490
You heard him.


27:30.660 --> 27:31.630
Get out.


27:31.660 --> 27:33.890
Lisa...


27:33.930 --> 27:35.460
I don't think this is a good idea.


27:35.490 --> 27:37.160
Get out!


28:25.160 --> 28:27.160
They took ben he's changed.


28:27.190 --> 28:28.790
What?! Are you sure?


28:28.830 --> 28:30.890
Yeah,i'm sure. I checked his windowsill.


28:30.930 --> 28:31.960
Blood?


28:31.990 --> 28:33.360
I don't think it is blood,


28:33.390 --> 28:35.460
And i think i know where the kids are.


28:50.690 --> 28:52.130
Red dirt.


28:52.160 --> 28:53.960
That's what was on the window.


28:53.990 --> 28:55.130
You take the front.


28:55.160 --> 28:57.090
I'll go around.


30:19.590 --> 30:21.730
ben..ben...it's okay.


30:21.760 --> 30:23.160
I'm gonna get you out of here.


30:26.590 --> 30:28.360
What do you think you're doing?


30:40.390 --> 30:41.830
This is private property.


30:41.860 --> 30:43.260
I'm calling the police.


30:54.930 --> 30:56.090
You heard me! Get out!


30:56.130 --> 30:57.730
Let me get my bag. I'm going.


30:57.760 --> 30:59.060
I don't mean to cause any trouble.


31:05.630 --> 31:07.590
Mommy?


31:07.630 --> 31:09.630
ben.. Play with me.


31:09.660 --> 31:11.990
This isn't funny anymore.
I put you to bed three times.


31:12.030 --> 31:15.160
I don't want to go to bed.


31:15.190 --> 31:16.590
I want to be with you,mommy.


31:16.630 --> 31:17.730
That's sweet,hon.


31:21.890 --> 31:22.760
Come on.


31:23.960 --> 31:24.930
Let's go.


31:28.560 --> 31:29.590
All right,come on.


31:29.630 --> 31:30.860
I'm hungry.


31:30.890 --> 31:32.230
Mini pizzas okay?


31:32.260 --> 31:33.660
Deluxe is all we've got.


31:33.690 --> 31:34.930
Okay.


31:34.960 --> 31:37.290
That's funny --
I thought we were anti-olives this month.


31:48.890 --> 31:51.200
it's ok. get out here ok?


31:57.590 --> 31:58.960
Come on,girls! Come on!


32:02.690 --> 32:04.330
Everybody back! Everybody back!


32:06.230 --> 32:07.330
Cover your eyes!


32:11.860 --> 32:14.230
Here. Use this.


32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
All right.


32:17.190 --> 32:18.860
All right,ben. Come on.


32:18.890 --> 32:19.890
Him first.


32:19.930 --> 32:22.130
Hey! Dean! There's a mother.


32:22.160 --> 32:23.190
A mother changeling?


32:23.230 --> 32:24.830
We got to get these kids out quick.


32:24.860 --> 32:26.730
Right there. There's one more.


32:26.760 --> 32:28.690
You got to break the lock!


32:28.730 --> 32:30.260
I guess that's why the changelings


32:30.290 --> 32:32.830
are keeping the kids alive
--so the mom can snack on them.


32:39.960 --> 32:41.330
What's wrong,mommy?


32:41.360 --> 32:42.860
You're not my son.


32:42.890 --> 32:44.560
Yes,i am. Where's ben?


32:44.590 --> 32:46.430
I'm ben.


32:46.460 --> 32:47.690
I love you,mommy.


33:01.260 --> 33:03.660
They don't want you to leave me,mommy.


33:07.360 --> 33:10.060
Mommy? Mommy?


33:13.890 --> 33:16.060
Let me in!


33:16.090 --> 33:17.760
What are you doing?!


33:17.790 --> 33:19.330
Let me in!


33:19.360 --> 33:22.230
Let me in! Let me in! let me in!


33:46.160 --> 33:48.090
ben,get them out of here!


34:40.460 --> 34:42.190
ben?!


34:42.230 --> 34:44.290
ben!


34:44.330 --> 34:46.260
baby,are you okay?


34:46.290 --> 34:47.760
i'm okay,mom.


34:47.790 --> 34:48.760
oh,my god.


34:54.030 --> 34:55.160
what the hell just happened?


34:55.190 --> 34:57.260
i'll explain everything if you want me to,


34:57.290 --> 34:59.030
but,trust me, you probably don't.


34:59.060 --> 35:02.490
the important thing is that ben's safe.


35:02.530 --> 35:04.260
thank you.


35:06.860 --> 35:08.030
thank you.


35:11.530 --> 35:13.160
i'm gonna give you guys some time.


35:14.590 --> 35:15.630
come on.


35:24.690 --> 35:25.790
changelings?


35:27.890 --> 35:30.060
you know how i never mentioned my job?


35:30.090 --> 35:31.660
this is my job.


35:31.690 --> 35:33.730
i so didn't want to know that.


35:36.090 --> 35:37.660
do you think he'll be okay?


35:37.690 --> 35:39.790
yeah. i think he'll be fine.


35:39.830 --> 35:41.960
okay. seriously...


35:41.990 --> 35:44.890
i mean,you're 100%
sure that he is not mine,right?


35:44.930 --> 35:46.030
you're off the hook.


35:46.060 --> 35:47.830
i did a blood test when he was a baby.


35:49.090 --> 35:51.990
there was this guy some
bar back in a biker joint.


35:53.230 --> 35:55.390
what? i had a type.


35:55.430 --> 35:58.530
leather jacket,couple of scars,
no mailing address


35:58.560 --> 35:59.560
i was there.


35:59.590 --> 36:02.190
guess i was a little wild back then...


36:03.730 --> 36:05.690
...before i became a mom.


36:06.930 --> 36:08.860
so,yeah. you can relax.


36:10.490 --> 36:12.430
good.


36:19.590 --> 36:21.130
i...


36:21.160 --> 36:22.960
i swear you look disappointed.


36:27.890 --> 36:29.890
yeah,i don't know.


36:29.930 --> 36:32.390
it's weird,you know your life.


36:32.430 --> 36:34.790
i mean,this house and kid.


36:34.830 --> 36:36.130
it's not my life...


36:36.160 --> 36:38.130
never will be.


36:38.160 --> 36:41.860
some stuff happened to me recently,and,uh...


36:44.630 --> 36:46.990
anyway,a guy in my situation --


36:47.030 --> 36:48.430
you start to think, you know.


36:48.460 --> 36:49.830
i'm gonna be gone one day,


36:49.860 --> 36:53.330
and what am i leaving behind besides a car?


36:53.360 --> 36:55.690
i don't know.


36:55.730 --> 36:57.160
ben may not be your kid,


36:57.190 --> 37:00.930
but he wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you.


37:02.490 --> 37:04.160
that's a lot if you ask me.


37:12.930 --> 37:15.960
you know, just for the record...

40:47.160 --> 40:49.260
not all demons are the same,sam.


40:49.290 --> 40:52.060
not all of us want the same thing.


40:52.090 --> 40:55.530
me?
i want to help you from time to time.


40:55.560 --> 40:56.660
that's all.


41:00.230 --> 41:05.130
and if you let me,
there's something in it for you.


41:05.160 --> 41:06.730

41:06.760 --> 41:08.890
i could help you save your brother.
