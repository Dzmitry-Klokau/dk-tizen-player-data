i don't care what it takes.
i'm gonna get you out of this.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.660
if we trap the crossroads demon

deal in any way,you die.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.860

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860

there was no such thing.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.430

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.930

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.560
it's not like i had a choice.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.230

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.060

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.360

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.330
i don't want dad to have a night anymore.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.060

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.160
you used to love going to your dad's house.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.760
you know,he loves you, and he misses you a lot.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.830

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.890

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.830
i don't w-want to go back.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.530

supernatural season 3 episode 2

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.730
what do you mean you don't
think it will work,bobby?

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.030
it's a demon-dispelling ritual.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.360
well,maybe we got the translation wrong.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.190

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.390
there's got to be something

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.730
yeah. no. i got to go.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.730

hey. who was that?

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.460
i was just ordering pizza.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.860

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.760
there's something better in
cicero than just a case.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.860
and that is?

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.960

just to hook up with some random chick?

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.760
she was a yoga teacher.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.530

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:07.190
i think there might be something...wrong with her.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.490
of course there is.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:09.890
the poor girl just lost her dad.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:10.930
she's devastated.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.560
no. that's not what i'm talking about.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.090
there is something really...

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.690
wrong with her.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.190
i'm not sure that katie is...katie.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.930

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.890
i'm not sure that's my daughter.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.430
i know you're grieving,but you can't talk like that.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.490
katie needs you.but you don't understand --

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.460

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.860

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.860

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.260
and save the damsel in distress.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.160

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.630
why?

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.860

and i love a tall man.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.030

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.160
i'm a good hunter.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.130
so,yellow eyes had some pretty
big plans for you,sam.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.530
"had" being the key word.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.260

good job with that.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.590
it doesn't change the fact that you're special...

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.360
and that anthony michael hall
e.s.p. visions come into play.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.660
no. that's stuff's not happening anymore...

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.160
not since yellow eyes died.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.730
well,i'm thinking you're still a pretty big deal.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.390
i mean,after all that business with your mom.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.630
what about my mom?

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.960
you know, what happened to her friends.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.630
you...don't know.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.560
you've got a little bit of catching up to do,my friend.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:18.160
so,why don't you look into your mom's pals

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.190
and then give me a call and we'll talk again?

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.460
and,by the way,

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.260
you do know there's a job in this town,right?

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.130
hello.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.330
dude,there is a job here.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.260
really?

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.260
yeah. you know that one freak accident

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.590
we read about in the paper?

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.030
there's four more that never
even made the paper,

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.130
all in this morning hill gated community.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.730
people falling off of ladders and
drowning in their jacuzzis

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.860
all over the neighborhood.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.760
-that is weird.  -yeah,something's up...

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.190
something these nice,
big gates can't protect them from.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.790
katie.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.330
what are you doing?

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.590
play with me,mommy.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.430
okay.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.460
sure. yeah let's,um,let's play.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.060
oh,good.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.130
i love you,mommy.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.590
i love you too,sweetie.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.590
i'm hungry,mommy.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.360
yeah.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.960
yeah.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.790
so,once again, i'm very sorry to disturb you.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.430
we just really want to expedite
that life-insurance policy.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.590
-of course.  -okay.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.030
this is,um,where he fell.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.090
i see.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.590
now,how exactly did he --

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.990
he was just inside changing a light bulb.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.590
must have lost his balance.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.530
-were you here when this happened?
-no. i was out.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.990
uh,the only one here was our daughter,dakota.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.830
okay.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.260
okay. well,uh,i think that's all i need.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.860
i'll get out of your way now.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.430
thank you.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.260
thank you,mommy.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.160
you eat.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.690
mommy will be right back.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.630
mommy?

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.960
just --  just give mommy a second.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.060
let me in.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.890
mommy.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.290
let me in.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.060
mommy!

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.590
let me in!

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.630

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.930
let me in! let me in! let me in!

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.930
let me in!

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.590
let me in!

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.390
give mommy a minute.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.590
aren't you just the cutest thing?

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.760
oh,thank you.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.090
uh,katie,could you put
these in the kitchen,please?

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.060
katie seems okay, considering

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.530
she's fine. yeah.um,look,i'm

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.390
and you -- how are you doing really?

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.960
i'm fine. look,we're fine.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.590
um,this isn't a good time

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.260
i wasn't sure if you were
keeping the house or selling.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.760
we at cicero realty would like

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.790
look,i told you it's not a good time!

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.290
i want ice cream.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.330
mommy,ice cream,please.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.490
hey,ben.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.890
hey.  you were at my party.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.790
yeah. yeah,i'm dean.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.690
everything okay? something wrong?

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.490
is that your game they're playing with?

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:04.030
ryan humphrey borrowed it,
and now he won't give it back.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.360
-well,you want me to go...
-no! don't go over there!

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.160
only bitches send a grown-up.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.830
you're not wrong.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.490
and i'm not a bitch.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.160
is that humphrey?

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.890
the one that needs to lay off the burgers?

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.060
ryan.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.560
i'd like my game back, please.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.990
fine. take it back.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.890
see? told you guys he was a

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:13.850
thanks

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.960
dude,that was awesome!

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.990
benjamin isaac braeden... what's gotten into you?

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.190
he stole my game.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.030
so you kick him? since when is...

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.290
did you tell my son to beat up that kid?

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.960
what? somebody had to teach him
how to kick the bully in the nads

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.460
-who asked you to teach him anything?
-just relax.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:38.860
what are you even still doing here?

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.330
we had one weekend
together a million years ago.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.090
you don't know me. you have
no business with my son.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.290
lisa.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.130
just leave us alone.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.630
ben!

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.130
thanks.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.330
i love you most in the
whole wide world,mommy.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.860
um,me,too,sweetie.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.660
come on,hold still.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:43.030
what's wrong,mommy?

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.860
nothing,sweetie.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.330
are we going for ice cream now?

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.990
yeah, we're going for ice cream.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.660
can i have the ice cream now?

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.030
kids in this town.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.530
yeah. tell me about it.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.330
so,what do you know about changelings?

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.490
evil monster babies?

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.590
no,not necessarily babies.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.660
they're kids...

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.890
creepy,"stare at you like you're lunch" kids.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.960
yeah.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.890
there's one at every victim's house.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.060
so,changelings can perfectly mimic children.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.360
according to lore,they climb in
the window,snatch the kid.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:44.890
there were marks on the windowsill

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.090
at one of the kid's houses.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.330
looked to me like blood.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.260
the changeling grabs a kid,
assumes its form,

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.530
joins the happy fam just for kicks?

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.760
not quite.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.790
changelings feed on the mom...

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.960
synovial fluid.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.730
the moms have these odd bruises on the back of their necks.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.700
changelings can drain them for a few weeks

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:08.990
before mom finally croaks.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.260
and then there's dad and the babysitter

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.790
yeah. seems like anyone who gets
between the changeling's food source ends up dead.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.630
and fire's the only way to waste them?

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.460
great. we'll just bust in, drag the kids out,

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:20.560
torch them on the front lawn.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.590
that will play great with the neighbors.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.290
what about the real ones?
what happens to them?

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:26.930
they stash them underground somewhere.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.730
i don't know why, but if it's true,

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.460
the real kids might be out there.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.330
we better start looking.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.030
so,any kid in the neighborhood is vulnerable?

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.930
-yep. -we got to make a stop.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.290
i want to check on someone.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.790
if the real kids are still alive,
we don't have time

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.460
we have to.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:47.960
dean

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.260
i was thinking... ben's birthday.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:51.330
i didn't bring him a present.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.590
that's okay.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.660
no. no. no. i feel terrible,so,uh...

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:56.690
here.

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:58.460
take a long weekend --

00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:59.890
just the two of you -- on me.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.090
what?

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.290
I hear six flags is great this time of year.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:04.660
Go now. avoid the traffic.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.330
"Siegfried Houdini."

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.430
Whose card is this?

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.460
Mine.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.660
Never mind. it'll work.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.660
I promise.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.060
You should leave.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:16.960
Lisa...

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.660
Mommy,what's wrong?

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.490
Nothing,Ben. It's cool.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:23.830
Make him go away,mommy.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.490
You heard him.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.630
Get out.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.890
Lisa...

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.460
I don't think this is a good idea.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.160
Get out!

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.160
They took ben he's changed.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:28.790
What?! Are you sure?

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.890
Yeah,i'm sure. I checked his windowsill.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:31.960
Blood?

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:33.360
I don't think it is blood,

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:35.460
And i think i know where the kids are.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.130
Red dirt.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.960
That's what was on the window.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:55.130
You take the front.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.090
I'll go around.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.730
ben..ben...it's okay.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.160
I'm gonna get you out of here.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.360
What do you think you're doing?

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:41.830
This is private property.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.260
I'm calling the police.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.090
You heard me! Get out!

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.730
Let me get my bag. I'm going.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.060
I don't mean to cause any trouble.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.590
Mommy?

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:09.630
ben.. Play with me.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.990
This isn't funny anymore.
I put you to bed three times.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:15.160
I don't want to go to bed.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.590
I want to be with you,mommy.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:17.730
That's sweet,hon.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:22.760
Come on.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.930
Let's go.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.590
All right,come on.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:30.860
I'm hungry.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.230
Mini pizzas okay?

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.660
Deluxe is all we've got.

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:34.930
Okay.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.290
That's funny --
I thought we were anti-olives this month.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.200
it's ok. get out here ok?

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.960
Come on,girls! Come on!

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.330
Everybody back! Everybody back!

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.330
Cover your eyes!

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.230
Here. Use this.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.160
All right.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:18.860
All right,ben. Come on.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:19.890
Him first.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.130
Hey! Dean! There's a mother.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.190
A mother changeling?

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.830
We got to get these kids out quick.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.730
Right there. There's one more.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.690
You got to break the lock!

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.260
I guess that's why the changelings

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.830
are keeping the kids alive
--so the mom can snack on them.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.330
What's wrong,mommy?

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.860
You're not my son.

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:44.560
Yes,i am. Where's ben?

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.430
I'm ben.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.690
I love you,mommy.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.660
They don't want you to leave me,mommy.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.060
Mommy? Mommy?

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.060
Let me in!

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:17.760
What are you doing?!

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.330
Let me in!

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.230
Let me in! Let me in! let me in!

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.090
ben,get them out of here!

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.190
ben?!

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.290
ben!

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.260
baby,are you okay?

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:47.760
i'm okay,mom.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:48.760
oh,my god.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.160
what the hell just happened?

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.260
i'll explain everything if you want me to,

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.030
but,trust me, you probably don't.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.490
the important thing is that ben's safe.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.260
thank you.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.030
thank you.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.160
i'm gonna give you guys some time.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:15.630
come on.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:25.790
changelings?

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.060
you know how i never mentioned my job?

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.660
this is my job.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:33.730
i so didn't want to know that.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.660
do you think he'll be okay?

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:39.790
yeah. i think he'll be fine.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.960
okay. seriously...

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.890
i mean,you're 100%
sure that he is not mine,right?

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.030
you're off the hook.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.830
i did a blood test when he was a baby.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.990
there was this guy some
bar back in a biker joint.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.390
what? i had a type.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:58.530
leather jacket,couple of scars,
no mailing address

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.560
i was there.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.190
guess i was a little wild back then...

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:05.690
...before i became a mom.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.860
so,yeah. you can relax.

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:12.430
good.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.130
i...

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.960
i swear you look disappointed.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:29.890
yeah,i don't know.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.390
it's weird,you know your life.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.790
i mean,this house and kid.

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.130
it's not my life...

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.130
never will be.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.860
some stuff happened to me recently,and,uh...

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.990
anyway,a guy in my situation --

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:48.430
you start to think, you know.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.830
i'm gonna be gone one day,

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.330
and what am i leaving behind besides a car?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.690
i don't know.

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.160
ben may not be your kid,

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.930
but he wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.160
that's a lot if you ask me.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.960
you know, just for the record...

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.390
you got a great kid.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.390
i would have been proud to be his dad.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.260
look,if,um...

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:38.330
if you want to stick around for a while...

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.290
you're welcome to stay.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.030
i can't.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.090
i got a lot of work to do, and it's not my life.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.560

some facts with your,uh...

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.560

about a fire that occurred
on november 24,2006,

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:17.960
in lawrence,kansas.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:19.790
hardecker was his name.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.290
okay. great.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.230
i was just trying to find out the date he died.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.290
this is police chief phil jones. july 13th.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.590
can you check the
records for a robert campbell?

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.190
july 19,2001.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.590
dead on arrival.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.760
what i'm after is cause of death.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:35.830
heart condition?

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.030
wasn't he a cardiac surgeon?

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.760
wouldn't he have known about that?

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:43.290
i'm looking for information on
on mrs. wallace's death.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:44.560
two deaths.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.590
who was the other?

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.090
ed campbell.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.890

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.260
oh,my god.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.690
they're dead all of them.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.730
all of my mom's friends.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.760
her doctor,her uncle --

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:12.330
everyone who ever knew her

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.290
systematically wiped off
the map one at a time.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:17.830
someone went through
a hell of a lot of trouble

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.760
trying to cover their tracks.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.430
the yellow-eyed demon.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.860
so,what's your deal?

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:26.390
you show up wherever i am.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.530
you know all about me.
you know all about my mom.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.360
i already told you. i'm

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.760
oh,right,right. yeah. just a hunter.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:33.990
just some hunter

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:36.230
who happens to know more about
my own family than i do.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.830
just tell me who you are.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.260
sam,it

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:44.630
just...tell me who you are.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.630
it doesn't matter.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.260
just tell me who you are!

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.730
fine.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.890
think twice before going for that holy water.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.130
give me one reason i should.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.290
i'm here to help you,sam.

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:04.430
is this some kind of joke?

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.430
god's honest truth...

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.630
or whatever.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:08.630
you're a demon.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.330
don't be such a racist.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.990
i'm here because i want to help you.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:16.530
and i can if you trust me.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.060
trust you?

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:19.360
sam,calm down.

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:21.760
start talking. all those murders...

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.260
- what was the demon trying to cover up?
- i don't know.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:25.360
what happened to my mother?

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.490
i honestly don't know.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.460
that's what i'm trying to find out.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:31.690
all i know is that it's about you.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.290
what?

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:35.990
don't you get it,sam?

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.490
it's all about you.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:40.060
what happened to your mom,
what happened to her friends

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.190
they're trying to cover
up what he did to you.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.130
and i want to help you figure it out.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.560
why would you want to help me?

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.130
i have my reasons.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.260
not all demons are the same,sam.

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:52.060
not all of us want the same thing.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.530
me?
i want to help you from time to time.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.660
that's all.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:05.130
and if you let me,
there's something in it for you.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.730
what could you possibly

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.890
i could help you save your brother.
