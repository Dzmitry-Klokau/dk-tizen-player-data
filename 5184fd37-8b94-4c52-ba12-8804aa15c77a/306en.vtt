=====Produced by YYeTs Team 9======

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.030
i'm busting my ass trying to keep you alive,dean,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.300
and you act like you couldn't care less.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.630
truth is,i'm tired,sam.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.160
it's like there's a light at the end of the tunnel.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000
it's hellfire,dean.whatever.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.530
you're my big brother.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.130
there's nothing i wouldn't do for you.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.930
and i don't care what it takes. i'm gonna get you out of this.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.360
well,what can i do for you,sam?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.160
you can let dean out of his deal right now.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.660
i'm just a saleswoman.i got a boss,like everybody.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.000
he holds the contract.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.230
and who's your boss?i can't tell you.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.000
i'm sorry,sam,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.430
but there's no way out of this one.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.000
supernatural season 3  episode 6

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.000
so,i've been waiting since maple springs.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.260
you got something to tell me?

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.260
it's not your birthday.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.700
no.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.060
happy purim?dude,i don't know.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.500
i have no idea what you're talking --

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.060
there's a bullet missing from the colt.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.560
you want to tell me how that happened?

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.130
i know it wasn't me.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.860
so unless you were shooting at some incredibly evil cans...

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.930
you went after her,didn't you?the crossroads demon.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.360
after i told you not to.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.360
yeah,well...

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.730
you could have gotten yourself killed!i didn't.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.900
and you shot her.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.200
she was a smartass.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.860
so,what? does that meani'm out of my deal?

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.430
don't you think

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.930
i might have mentioned that little fact,dean?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.930
no. someone else holds the contract.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.360
- who?
- she wouldn't say.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.260
well,we should find out who.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.930
of course,our best lead would be the crossroads demon.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.260
oh,wait a minute...

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.900
- that's not funny.
- no,it's not!

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.730
it was a stupid freaking risk,and you shouldn't have done it.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.100
i shouldn't have done it?

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.500
you're my brother,dean.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.300
and no matter what you do,i'm gonna try and save you.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.030
and i'm sure as hell not gonnaapologize for it,all right?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.460
but i don't understand.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.600
i already went over all this with the other detectives.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.100
right,yes.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.130
but,see,we're with the sheriff's department,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.830
not the police department --different departments.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.760
so,mrs. case...

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.360
please.ms. case.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.830
okay.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.530
um,ms. case,um...

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.460
you were the one who found your niece,correct?

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.430
i came home,she was in the shower.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.430
drowned?

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.260
so the coroner says.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.030
now,you tell me,how can someone drown in the shower?

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.300
how would you describe

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.260
sheila's behavior in the days before her death?

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.260
i mean,did she seem frightened?

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.600
maybe she said something out of the ordinary?

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.500
wait a minute.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.430
you're working with alex,aren't you?

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.300
yep. absolutely.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.630
alex and us,we're like this.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.330
why didn't you say so?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.700
alex has been such a comfort.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.660
but i'm sorry.i thought the case was solved.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.460
well,no.no,not yet.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.900
i see.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.160
so,anyways,we were talking about your niece.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.730
well,yes.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.830
sheila mentioned something quite strange before she died.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.730
she said she saw a boat.a boat?

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.530
yes. one minute it was there,then it was gone.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.500
it just disappeared right before her eyes.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.200
you think it could be a ghost ship?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.530
alex thinks it could be a ghost ship.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.400
could be.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.360
you let me know if there's anything else i can do for you.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.160
anything at all.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.030
what a crazy,old broad.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.530
why? because she believes in ghosts?

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.100
look at you.sticking up for your girlfriend.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.060
- you cougar hound.
- bite me.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.630
not if she bites you first.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.260
so,who's this alex?we got another player in town?

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.430
maybe,maybe not.doesn't change our job.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.200
and what looked like a ghost ship,right?

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.300
it's not the first one sighted around here,either.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.400
every 37 years,like clockwork,

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.830
reports of a vanishing three-mast clipper ship

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.100
out in the bay.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.960
and every 37 years,a rash of weirdo,dry-land drownings.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.330
- so,whatever's happening is just getting started.
- yeah.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.660
what's the lore?

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.560
well,there are apparitions of old wrecks

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.000
sighted all over the world.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.450
the s.s. violet,the griffin

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.700
the flying dutchman

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.760
almost all of them are death omens.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.960
so,you see the ship and then a few hours later,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.830
you pucker up and kiss your ass goodbye?

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.860
basically.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.230
what's the next step?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.230
i got to i.d. the boat.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.360
that shouldn't be too hard.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.130
i mean,how many three-mast clipper ships

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.260
have wrecked off the coast?

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.200
i checked that too,actually.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.060
over 150.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.100
crap.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.330
this is where we parked the car,right?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.760
i thought so.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.430
where's my car?

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.660
did you feed the meter?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.400
yes,i fed the meter.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.530
sam,where's my car?somebody stole my car!

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.300
calm down.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.430
i am calmed down!somebody stole my ca--

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.700
oh,my god.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.100
take it easy.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.860
the '67 impala?was that yours?

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.860
bela

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.200
i'm sorry.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.200
- i had that car towed.
- you what?!

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.200
- well,it wasin a tow-away zone.
- no,it wasn't!

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.230
it was when i finished with it.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.200
what the hell are you even doing here?

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.800
a little yachting.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.600
you're alex.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.860
you're working with that old lady.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.400
gert's a dear old friend.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.400
yeah,right.what's your angle?

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.700
there's no angle.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.200
there's a lot of lovely old women like gert

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.200
up and down the eastern seaboard.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.630
i sell them charms,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.460
perform seances so they can commune with their dead cats.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.700
and let me guess,it's all a con.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.760
the comfort i provide them is very real.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.760
how do you sleep at night?

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.160
on silk sheets,rolling naked in money.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.160
really,sam,i'd expect the attitude from him. but you?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.060
you shot me.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.630
i barely grazed you.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.860
cute. but a bit of a drama queen,yeah?

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.260
you do know what's going on around here.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.000
this ghost-ship thing,it is real.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.430
i'm aware.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.080
thanks for telling gert the case wasn't solved

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.030
by the way.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.430
it isn't.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.760
she didn't know that.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.930
now the old bag's stopped payment

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.160
and she's demanding some real answers.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.600
look...

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.790
just stay out of my way

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.330
before you cause any more trouble.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.130
i'd get to that car if i were you...

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.330
before they find the arsenal in the trunk.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.930
ciao.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.400
can i shoot her?

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.330
not in public.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.730
hello?

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.540
police said that he drowned,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.340
but i don't u-understand how...

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.040
i am so sorry for your loss,mr. warren.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.900
now,if you could just tell me one more time

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.340
about the ship your brother saw.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.500
ma'am,i think this man's been through quite enough.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.140
you should go.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.640
but i just have a few more questions.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.740
no,you don't.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.570
thank you for your time.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.470
sorry you had to deal with that. they're like roaches.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.170
so,we heard you say your brother saw a ship.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.740
yeah,that's right.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.900
did he tell you what it looked like?

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.440
it was,uh... like the old yankee clippers.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.300
a smuggling vessel.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.970
the rakish topsail,a barkentine rigging.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.900
angel figurehead on the bow.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.200
that's a lot of detail for a ship your brother saw.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.440
my brother and i were night diving.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:56.940
i saw the ship,too.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.470
excuse me,officers,

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.640
i'm not sure those men are detectives.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.070
all right. well,we'll be in touch.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.500
thank you.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.100
i see you got your car back.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.200
you really want to come near me

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.540
when i got a loaded gun in my hands?

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.840
now,now. mind your blood pressure.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.540
why are you even still here?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.770
you have enough to i.d. the boat?

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.940
that guy back there saw the ship.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.940
yeah? and?

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.340
and he's going to die,so we have to save him.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.400
how sweet.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.500
you think this is funny?

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.740
he's cannon fodder.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.300
he can't be saved in time,and you know it.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.200
yeah,well,see,we have souls,so we're gonna try.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.340
well,i'm actually gonna find the ship and put an end to this.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.640
but you have fun.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.300
hey,bela,how'd you get like this,huh?

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.570
what,did daddy not give you enough hugs or something?

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.040
i don't know. your daddy give you enough?

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.970
don't you dare look down your nose at me.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.300
you're not better than i am.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.440
we help people.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.670
come on.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.900
you do this out of vengeance and obsession.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.400
you're a stone's throw from being a serial killer.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.240
whereas i,on the other hand,

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.640
i get paid to do a job and i do it.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.600
so,you tell me -- which is healthier?

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.140
bela,why don't you just leave? we've got work to do.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.270
yeah. you're 0 for 2.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.870
bang-up job so far.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.470
anything good?

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.240
no. not really.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.070
i mean,both brothers are duke university grads.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.240
no criminal record.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.000
i mean,a few speeding tickets.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.440
they inherited their father's real estate fortune

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.640
six years ago.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.640
- how much?
- $112 million.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.970
nice life.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.600
yeah. i mean,nice,clean,aboveboard.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.870
so,why did they see the ship?

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.340
why sheila,too? what do they all have in common?

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.500
maybe nothing.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.900
no. there's always something.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.700
hey,you!

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.440
i think we've been made.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.370
what are you guys doing?! you watching me?!

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.870
sir,calm down. please.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.200
you guys aren't cops!

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.870
not dressed like that. not -- not in that crappy car.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.470
whoa,hey. no need to get nasty.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.240
we are cops,okay? we're undercover.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.370
we're here because we think you're in danger.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.440
from who?!

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.600
if you just settle down,we'll talk about it.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.470
look,you guys just stay away from me!

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.400
wait.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.040
hey,you moron! we're trying to help you!

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.670
- that can't be good.
- no.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.370
get the salt gun.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.040
peter!

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.900
sam!

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.900
come on.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.010
you want to say it,or should i?

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.540
what?

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.540
you can't save everybody,sam.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.470
yeah,right. so -- so,what? you feel better now or what?

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:29.910
no. not really.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.740
me neither.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.280
you got to under--

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.040
it's just lately i feel like i can't save anybody.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.910
dear god...

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.470
are you actually squatting?

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.570
charming.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.770
so,how did things go last night with peter?

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.240
that well,huh?

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.310
if you say "i told you so,"

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.810
i swear to god,i'll start swinging.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.140
look,i think the three of us should have a heart-to-heart.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.380
that's assuming you have a heart.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.240
dean,please.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.970
i'm sorry about what i said before,okay?

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.110
i come bearing gifts.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.710
such as?

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.940
i've i.d.'d the ship.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.070
it's the espirito santo,a merchant sailing vessel.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.240
quite a colorful history.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.010
in 1859,a sailor was accused of treason.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.740
he was tried aboard ship in a kangaroo court and hanged.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:19.910
he was 37.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.240
which would explain the 37-year cycle.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.710
aren't you a sharp tack?

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.740
there's a photo of him somewhere.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.010
here.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.240
isn't that the customer we saw last night?

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.010
you saw him?

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.510
yeah,that's him. except he was missing a hand.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.070
- his right hand.
- how did you know?

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.610
the sailor's body was cremated,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.810
but not before they cut off his hand to make a hand of glory.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.010
a hand of glory?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.770
i think i got one of those

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.010
at the end of my thai massage last week.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.540
dean,the right hand of a hanged man

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.110
is a serious occult object.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.310
it's very powerful. so they say.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.910
and officially counts as remains.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.610
none of this explains why the ghost is choosing these victims.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.640
i'll tell you why. who cares?

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.110
find the hand,burn it,and stop the bloody thing.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.910
i don't get it. why are you telling us all this?

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.140
because i know exactly where the hand is.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.910
- where?
- at the sea pines museum.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.540
it's a macabre bit of maritime history.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.310
but i need help.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.440
what kind of help?

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.640
what is taking so long?

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.610
sam's already halfway there.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.910
with his date.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.440
i'm so not okay with this.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.470
what are you,a woman?

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.210
come down,already.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.440
all right. get it out. i look ridiculous.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.840
not exactly the word i'd use.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.640
what?

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.640
you know,when this is over,

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.640
we should really have angry sex.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.310
don't objectify me.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.640
let's go.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.410
are you chewing gum?

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.310
try to behave as if you've lived this life before.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.640
yeah?

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:21.240
this will get their tongues wagging,eh,my adonis?

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.340
just remember,we're on business.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.540
oh,but sometimes business can be pleasure,hmm?

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.010
right.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.970
you know,uh,could you excuse me for a moment?

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.910
great. thanks. thanks.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.770
exactly how long do you expect me to entertain my date?

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.670
as long as it takes.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.670
look,there's security all over this place,all right?

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.740
this is an uncrashable party without gert's invitation,so...

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:56.970
we can crash anything,dean.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.340
yeah,i know.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.710
but this is easier,and it's a lot more entertaining.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.170
you know there are limits to what i'll do,right?

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.570
aw,he's playing hard-to-get. that's cute.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.170
come on.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.280
i want all the details in the morning.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.670
to us.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.610
private security?

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.110
i don't think so.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.540
look at the way they're standing.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.870
they're pros.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.540
probably state troopers moonlighting.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.970
posted to every door,too.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.280
yeah.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.610
i don't think we're gonna be able to just waltz upstairs.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.540
what do you suggest?

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.110
i'm thinking.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.010
don't strain yourself.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.070
interesting,how the legend is so much more than the man.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:20.840
you got any bright ideas,i'm all ears.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.210
okay.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:29.040
honey? honey? are you all right?

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.140
waiter...

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.970
hi,uh,my wife has a severe shellfish allergy.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.840
- there's no crab in that?
- no,sir.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.280
no?

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.170
oh,they're excellent,by the way.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.870
what seems to be the trouble?

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.770
uh,the champagne.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.010
my wife she's a lightweight when it comes to the sauce.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.040
is there somewhere i can lay her down

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.910
till she gets her sea legs back?

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.210
follow me.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.240
right.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.670
thank you.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.310
come on,you lush.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.640
you think she's a pain in the ass now,

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.240
try living with her.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.640
thank you very much.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.770
hey,maybe next time give me a little heads-up with your plan.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.240
i didn't want you thinking.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.240
you're not very good at that.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.110
oh,look at you. searching for a witty rejoinder?

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.440
screw you.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.510
very oscar wilde.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.570
room 235.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.070
it's in a locked glass case wired for alarm.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.040
i'm sure that won't be a problem.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.010
where's alex and your friend?

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.710
they're missing a great party.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.510
i'm,uh i'm sure they're entertaining themselves.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.710
naughty.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.280
then i guess we'll just have to entertain ourselves.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.810
y-you know,um,mrs. case...

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.470
i'm sorry.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.810
ms. case,i don't want to give you the wrong idea.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.810
call me gert.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.870
okay.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:27.210
you remind me of my late husband.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.770
he was shy,too.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.840
till we got belowdeck.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.940
you're just firm all over.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.070
sir? ma'am?

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.040
everything all right?

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.210
hi.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.740
feeling better,i see?

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:39.540
yes. much. thank you.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.280
so if you're...done with the room?

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.380
well,not exactly.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.940
could we have a few more minutes?

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.710
uh,yes,ma'am.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.540
stop it. that tickles.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.840
sorry.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.840
it's,uh... nature called.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.170
thanks for looking after my wife.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.170
oh,she's being looked after,all right.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.210
any trouble?

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.640
nothing i couldn't handle.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.840
the hand?

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.910
may i?

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.170
no.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.940
it might be more inconspicuous in my purse.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.610
nice try.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.740
just trying to be helpful.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.610
well,sweetheart,i don't need your kind of help.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.910
man,this is one long song.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.540
i hope it never ends.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.640
how's the investigation going?

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.170
these things take time.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.440
people are talking about the warren brothers' deaths.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.280
strange.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:12.010
do you think it's connected to sheila's?

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.840
yeah. yeah,we think so.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.940
i think they had it coming,you know,

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:18.570
in a biblical sort of way.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.210
what do you mean?

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.570
you know about their father.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.310
no.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.610
come here. i'll whisper it to you.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.770
people say...

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:37.040
that the old man didn't die of natural causes.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.210
then how?

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.340
rumor is the boys did it.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:47.470
nothing was ever proved,but people still whisper.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:48.710
o-okay,okay.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.010
so,did did sheila have any connection to them?

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.070
well,none that i know of.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.510
did sheila have any kind of tragedy in her life?

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.510
yes.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.110
as a matter of fact,

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.040
there was a car accident when she was a teenager.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.380
what happened?

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.510
her car flipped over.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:10.870
well,she was okay,but her cousin brian was killed.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.470
why? is that important?

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.070
having a nice time?

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.310
he's delightful.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.340
he wants me.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:28.510
i'm going to get gert into a cold shower.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.040
great idea.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.640
see you at the cemetery.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.810
you stink like sex.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.140
you got it,right?

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:56.440
tell me i didn't get groped all night by mrs. havisham for nothing.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.210
i got it.mrs. who?

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.840
never mind.just let me see it.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.410
what?

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.870
i'm gonna kill her.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.280
oh,no.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.050
you know what?you're right.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:57.650
i'm not gonna kill her.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.850
i think slow torture's the way to go.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.550
dean,look,you got to relax.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.780
relax?! oh,yeah.yeah,i'll relax.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:09.320
you.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:13.820
what?

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.480
i-i mean,she got one over on you,not us.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.950
thank you,sam!it's very helpful!

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:31.780
hello? could you open up?

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.650
just let me explain.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.580
i sold it.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.320
i had a buyer lined up  as soon as i knew it existed.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.750
so,the whole reason for us going to the charity ball was...

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.990
i needed a cover.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.390
you were convenient.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.580
look,you sold it to a buyer.just go buy it back.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.420
it's halfway across the ocean.i can't get it back in time.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.550
in time for what?

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.520
what's going on with you,bela?

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.650
you look like you've seen a ghost.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.020
i saw the ship.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.820
you what?

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.320
i-i knew you were an immoral,thieving,con-artist bitch,

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.050
but just when i thought my opinion of you couldn't get any lower...

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.290
what are you talking about?

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.390
we figured out the spirit's motive.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:36.150
this is the captain of our ship,

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.880
the one who hung our ghost boy.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.780
so?

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.250
so,they were brothers.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.290
so,now our spirit,

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.990
he's going after a very specific kind of target --

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.320
people who've spilled their own  family's blood.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:54.250
see,first,there was sheila,

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.750
who killed her cousin in a car accident.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.090
and the warren brothers,

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.650
who murdered their father for the inheritance.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.950
and now you.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.020
my god.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.350
so,who was it,bela?hmm?

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.150
who'd you kill?

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:11.480
was it daddy?

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.220
your little sis,maybe?

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.620
it's none of your business.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:17.920
no.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.290
right.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.250
well,have a nice life --you know,whatever's left of it.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.650
sam,let's go.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.120
you can't just leave me here.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.020
watch us.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:34.450
please.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.190
i need your help.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.290
our help?

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.620
well,now,

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:45.220
how could a couple of serial killers possibly help you?

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:46.850
okay,that was a bit harsh,i admit it.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.550
but it doesn't warrant a death sentence.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.250
that's not why you're gonna die.

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:54.880
what did you do,bela?

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.680
you wouldn't understand.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.420
no one did.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.320
never mind.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.450
i'll just do what i've always done.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.480
i'll deal with it myself.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.780
you do realize

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.290
you just sold the only thing that could save your life.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.550
i'm aware.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.880
well...

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.620
...maybe not the only thing.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.090
do you really think this is gonna work?

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.090
almost definitely not.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:08.620
sammy,you better start reading.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:37.090
stay close!

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.850
behind you!

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.880
sam,read faster!

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.650
you...hanged me!

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.250
i'm sorry.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:51.150
your own brother!

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.120
i'm so sorry.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.420
you boys should learn to lock your doors.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.720
anyone could just barge in.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.690
anyone just did.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.120
did you come to say goodbye or thank you?

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.460
i've come to settle affairs.

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:43.560
giving the spirit what he really wanted -- his own brother.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.990
very clever,sam.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.220
it's $10,000. that should cover it.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.190
i don't like being in anyone's debt.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.590
so,ponying up 10 grand is easier for you

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.960
than a simple thank you?

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.020
you're so damaged.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.820
takes one to know one.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.190
goodbye,lads.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.520
she got style. you got to give her that.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.060
i suppose.

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.890
you know,dean,we don't know where this money's been.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.360
no...

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.090
...but i know where it's going.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:33.060
seriously?

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:34.520
atlantic city?

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.060
hell yeah.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:40.160
play some roulette. always bet on black.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.320
hey,listen,i've been doing some thinking.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.060
um,i want you to know i understand why you did it.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.790
i understand why you went after the crossroads demon.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.090
you know,situation was reversed,

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.320
i guess i'd have done the same thing.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.790
i mean,i'm not blind.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:04.120
i see what you're going through with this whole deal

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.720
me going away and all that.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.760
but you're gonna be okay.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.820
you think so.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.590
yeah. you'll keep hunting.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.890
you know,you'll live your life.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.320
you're stronger than me. you are.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:23.260
you are. you'll get over it.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:24.720
but i want you to know i'm sorry.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.920
i'm sorry for putting you through all this.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.020
you know what,dean? go screw yourself.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.290
what?

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.320
i don't want an apology from you.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.120
and by the way,i'm a big boy now.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.790
- i can take care of myself.
- oh,well,excuse me.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.460
so would you please quit worrying about me?

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.120
that's the whole problem in the first place!

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.260
i don't want you to worry about me,dean.

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.090
i want you to worry about you.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.920
i want you to give a crap that you're dying!

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.560
so,that's it? nothing else to say for you?

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.390
i think maybe i'll play craps.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
