00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.700
i know about sam's visions.
i know everything.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.530
gordon should be reaching for the soap

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.360
for the next few years,at least.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.500
you were right about everything.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.900
sam winchester is
more than a monster.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.660
i'm not even sure he's human.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.500
we got to get me the hell out of here.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.200
it's rude to sneak up on people.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.860
bela talbot.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.430
you have me at a disadvantage.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.400
i don't know who you are.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.230
gordon walker.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.830
i've heard of you.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.760
heard you were in prison.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.100
got out.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.330
released early on good behavior?

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.760
you looking for this?

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.100
i know you were just
in massachusetts,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.300
and i know you were with
the winchester boys.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.830
tell me where they are.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.530
i don't think i know.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.960
why don't you think a little harder?

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.090
put that down.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.430
what's so pressing about
finding the boys,anyway?

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.500
sam winchester's the antichrist.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.800
i'd heard something
about that... it's true.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.430
... from my good friend,
the easter bunny,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.530
who'd heard it from the tooth fairy.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.560
are you off your meds?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.630
the world hangs in the balance.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.990
so you go ahead and be
a smart-ass,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.860
but tell me where they are,
or i shoot.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.930
gordon,you and i don't know
each other very well,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.830
so let me tell you a little
something about me.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.930
i don't respond well to threats,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.500
but you make me an offer,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.330
and i think you'll find
me highly cooperative.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.290
okay.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.530
how about...

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.700
you tell me where they are,
or i kill you right now?

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.090
kill me.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.800
good luck finding sam and dean.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.660
i can wrangle up three grand.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.030
i don't get out of bed for three grand.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.230
you...

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.730
scratch that.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.360
give me the mojo bag,
and we'll call it even.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.860
oh,hell,no.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.930
this thing's a century old. it's...

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.530
priceless.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.860
believe me,i know.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.360
now,how badly do you
want the winchesters?

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.060
hello,dean?

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.160
hey,where are you?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.500
supernatural season 3 episode 7

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.060
hey,hey. don't worry.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.760
we're gonna call you some help,okay?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.860
where is she? where'd she go?!

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.900
smell that?!

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.630
come and get it!

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.730
that's right.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.230
come on.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.990
i smell good,don't i?

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.500
i taste even better.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.530
come on!

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.530
free lunch!

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.260
what?

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.180
cutting it a little close,
don't you think?

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.480
ah,that's just chum in the water.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.480
worked,didn't it?

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.380
you with us?

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.610
oh,yeah,sorry.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.450
you're not going anywhere.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.550
where's your nest? what?

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.550
nest... where you and your
bloodsucking pals hang out.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.980
i don't know what
you're talking about.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.110
please!

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.450
i don't feel good.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.150
yeah,well,you're gonna feel
a hell of a lot worse

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.810
if we give you another shot
of dead man's blood.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.480
just let me go.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.950
yeah,you know we can't do that.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.750
i'm telling you the truth.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.810
i'm just... i took something.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.280
i'm freaking out!

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.680
i don't know what's going on!

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.510
you took something? yes!

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.350
i can't...calm down.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.850
i just want to calm down.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.680
what's your name?

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.780
lucy.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.910
please,just let me go.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.250
all right,lucy,how about this?

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.310
if you tell us what happened,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.980
we'll let you go.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.210
you will?

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.650
uh,i don't really...

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.650
um,it's not that clear.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.880
i was at spider.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.550
spider?

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.310
the club on jefferson.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.680
and there was this guy...
he was buying me drinks.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.110
this guy... what's he look like?

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.050
he was old,like 30.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.150
he had brown hair,a leather jacket...

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.180
deacon or dixon or something.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.910
said he was a dealer...
he had something for me.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.550
- something?
- something new.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.910
"better than anything you've ever tried."

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.150
he put a few drops in my drink.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.650
was the drug red and thick?

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.010
well,genius move there.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.180
that was vampire blood he dosed you with.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.480
what?

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.880
you just took a big shot of
the nastiest virus out there.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.680
you're crazy!

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.180
he gave me roofies or something!

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.680
no...

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.080
the next thing i know,we're at his place,

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.050
and he says he's gonna get
me something to eat,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.750
just wait.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.710
but i get so hungry.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.050
so you busted out?

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.580
but it won't wear off...

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.280
whatever he gave me?

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.550
lights are too bright?

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.480
sunshine hurt your skin?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.380
yeah...

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.710
and smells.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.610
and i can... hear blood pumping.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.280
i hate to tell you this,sweetheart,

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.050
but your blood's never pumping again.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.150
not mine...

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.050
yours.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.510
i can hear a heart beating from
half a block away.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.010
i just want it to stop.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.250
it's not going to stop.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.780
you've already killed two people...
almost three.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.150
no,i couldn't.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.410
- i was hallucinating!
- you killed them,all right?

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.250
we've been following a sloppy
trail of corpses,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.950
and it leads straight to you.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.610
no. no,it wasn't real!

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.810
it was the drug!

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.680
please!

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.210
please,you have to help me!

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.010
no,no.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.480
poor girl.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.250
we don't have a choice.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.710
no...please!

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.810
sir,a few questions about the attack.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.180
i already talked to the cops.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.810
well,we're not cops. we're fbi.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.150
fbi?

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.650
can you describe your attacker?

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.410
she was crazy.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:04.250
she had that,uh,super-pcp strength,you know?

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.710
she gnawed on my neck.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.910
and did she bleed on you?

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.350
on me,no.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.550
in your mouth,open wound,anything?

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.980
- you sure about that?
- yeah,i'm sure. why?

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.850
this woman has a very dangerous virus.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.650
what? she bit me in the neck.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.880
the bite doesn't matter.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.810
you have to actually ingest
the blood to be infected.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.450
good thing,too. we'd have had to kill you.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.050
the attack?

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.980
she jumped me,then bit me.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.710
then those two guys found me
and chased her down the alley.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.180
- what did they look like?
- i didn't get a good look.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.380
think.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.810
one of them was real tall.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.410
that was a big,fat waste of time.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:57.480
look,three blondes have gone
missing,including lucy...

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.650
all last sighted here.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.380
i'm telling you,dean,this is the hunting ground.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.850
you're sick.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.680
you ready,sweetie?

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.210
one taste of this,you'll never be the same.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.510
get out of here. go! go!

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.450
dean!

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.010
i'm good. come on.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.300
all right. run. i'll draw them off.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.070
what?! you're crazy!

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.970
there you are!

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.300
yeah.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.300
sorry,i stopped for a slice.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.270
nice move you pulled back there,dean...

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.840
running right at the weapons.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.500
well,what can i say? i'm a bad-ass.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.770
so,i guess gordon's out of jail.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.370
uh,yeah,i guess so.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.900
how the hell did he know where to find us?

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.770
that bitch.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.700
- hi,bela.
- hello,dean.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.040
question for you.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.570
when you called me yesterday,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.640
it wasn't to thank me for
saving your ass,was it?

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.540
gordon walker paid me to tell
him where you were.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:36.970
excuse me?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.600
well,he had a gun on me.
what else was i supposed to do?

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.540
i don't know,maybe pick up the phone

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.570
and tell us that a raging
psychopath was dropping by!

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.400
i did fully intend to call.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.370
- i just got a bit sidetracked.
- he tried to kill us!

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.440
i'm sorry. i didn't realize
it was such big deal.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.370
after all,there are two
of you and one of him.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.840
there were two of them.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.840
bela,if we make it out of this alive,

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.500
the first thing i'm gonna do is kill you.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.170
you're not serious.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.840
listen to my voice and tell me
if i'm serious.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.540
i know you're uncomfortable...

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.170
but this is just temporary.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.240
the hunger will pass,and then
you'll feel much better.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.400
- you're awake.
- who are they?

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.570
family.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.440
you always keep your family in shackles?

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.440
we're still getting to know each other.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.300
they've just been reborn.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.370
you mean you grabbed some
poor girls off the street

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.670
and made them monsters like you.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.970
i do what i have to.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
we're a dying breed.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.240
but,then,you know that,
don't you,gordon?

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.100
gordon walker...

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.340
one of the greatest
living vampire hunters.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.040
in the flesh.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.940
you're a big part of why my
people are nearly extinct.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.940
your "people" are going extinct

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.970
because you're a bunch of mindless,
bloodthirsty animals.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.870
right.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.170
we're so much more bloodthirsty than you.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.040
hunters slaughtered my entire nest

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.140
like they were having a party...

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.270
murdered my daughter.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.640
i can't tell you how satisfying this is...

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.640
catching a hunter
responsible for so many deaths

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:11.070
and making you lunch for my new daughters.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.140
"daughters?"

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.100
try "fang whores."

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.400
watch your mouth.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.800
oh,did i hurt your feelings? i'm sorry.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.100
i forgot you're just a
misunderstood victim...

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.170
even though you murder and
spread your filthy disease

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.070
on pure base instinct.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.000
you got less humanity
than a sewer rat.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.000
i'm sorry you have such
a low opinion of my people.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.970
oh,you have no idea.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.900
sorry,change of plans.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.940
i'll be going out to get your lunch.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.170
i've got a better idea for you.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.040
no!

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.800
no!

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.500
no!!

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.140
that vampire's still out there,dean.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.300
first things first.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.640
gordon.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.300
about that... when we find him,
or if he finds us...

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.270
i'm just saying he's not leaving
us a whole lot of options.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.240
yeah,i know. we've got to kill him.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.740
really?

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.800
just like that?

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.000
i thought you would have been like,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.500
"no,we can't. he's human. it's wrong."

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.240
no,i'm done.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.900
gordon's not gonna
stop until we're dead...

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.070
... or till he is.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.840
what?!

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.940
i don't like it when people
hold grudges against me,

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.100
and more to the point,
i'd rather you didn't kill me,

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.440
so i went ahead and found gordon's
exact location for you.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.570
you're a hundred miles away.
how the hell did you...

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.670
hello?
purveyor of powerful occult objects?

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.000
i used a talking board to
contact the other side.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.500
- and?
- warehouse.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.440
two stories,riverfront,
neon sign outside.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.640
thanks. one more thing...

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.040
the spirit had a message for you.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.440
"leave town,run like hell,
and whatever you do,

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.270
don't go after gordon."

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.270
for whatever that's worth

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.900
please  help us

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.170
please

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.570
go ahead

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.310

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.640
kill me

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.340
what happened here?

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.370
gordon walker

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.340
i never should have brought a hunter here

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:48.540
never

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.040
i just

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.040
i just wanted some kind of revenge

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.170
stupid... exposing him to my family

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.840
oh,yeah,you're such a family man

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.640
you don't understand

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.740
i don't want to understand,you son

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.310
i was desperate you ever felt desperate?

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.840
i've lost everyone i ever loved

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.770
i'm staring down eternity alone

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.170
can you think of a worse hell?

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.170
well,there's hell

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.910
i wasn't thinking

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.910
i just

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.010
i didn't care anymore

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.740
do you know it's like

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.610
when you just don't give a damn?

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.940
it's like

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.140
it's like being dead already

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.010
so just go ahead

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.170
do it

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.010
dean

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.670
head wasn't cut off,it was ripped off

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.710
with someone's bare hands

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:09.340
Dixon,what did you do to gordon?

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.370
Gordon

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.110

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.910
not even close

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.640
i thought maybe you were dead

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.110

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.070

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.710
they turned me

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.070
those fangs?

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.240
I'm sorry

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.970
you know what this means

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:23.810
It means you have to kill me

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.770
but not yet

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.310

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.940
you have to let me do
one last thing first

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.840

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.170
- kill sam winchester

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.910
it is the one good thing
to come out of this nightmare

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.810
gordon i'm sorry

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.710

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.510
there is nothing more important

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.170

thing for the world

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.440
yeah i hear you

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.840

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.940
you're right

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:36.570
one last good thing

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.340
i'm sorry

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.070
man,i must have checked three dozen motels,

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.840
empty buildings,warehouses

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.540
yeah,me too

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.070
big city

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:23.810
it's like a giant haystack
and gordon's a deadly needle

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:26.940
we're running out of daylight

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.570
won't have the sun slowing him down

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.740
yeah,he'll be unstoppable

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.910
hey,give me your phone

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.570
what for?

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.870
well,if gordon knows
our cell numbers

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:41.040
he can use the cell
signal to track us down

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.040
oh,yeah thanks

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.140
sammy,stay here

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.810
what? where you going now?

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.470
i'm going after gordon

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.870
what?

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.210
you heard me

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.640
not alone,you're not

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.740
sam,i don't need you to sign
me a permission slip,okay?

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.340
he's after you,not me,
and he's turbocharged

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.470
i want you to stay out of harm's way

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.710
i'll take care of it

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.770
you're not going by yourself
you're gonna get killed

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:15.470
just another day at the office

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.770
it's a massively dangerous
day at the office

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:20.270
so you're the guy with nothing
to lose now,huh?

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.140
oh,wait let me guess because,uh

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:23.570
it's because you're
already dead,right?

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.110
- if the shoe fits
- you know what,man?

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.640
i'm sick and tired of
your kamikaze trip

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.770
whoa,whoa kamikaze?

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.670
i'm more like a ninja

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.240
- that's not funny
- it's a little funny

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.240
no,it's not

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.840
what do you want me to do,sam,huh...

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:42.270
sit around all day writing sad
poems about how i'm gonna die?

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.940
you know what? i got one

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.870
let's see what rhymes with "shut up,sam"?

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.070
dude drop the attitude,dean

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.870
quit turning everything into a punch line

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.140
and you know something else?

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.940
stop trying to act like you're not afraid

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.610
- I'm not!
- You're lying

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.170
you may as well drop it 'cause
i can see right through you

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.640
you got no idea what
you're talking about

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.540
yeah,i do you're scared,dean

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.840
you're scared because your
year is running out

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.940
and you're still going
to hell and you're freaked

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:10.870
- and how do you know that?
- because i know you!

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.070
really?

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.470
yeah,i've been following
you around my entire life!

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:19.110
i mean,i've been looking up
to you since i was four,dean...

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.270
studying you,trying to be
just like my big brother

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.740
so,yeah,i know you...

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.470
better than anyone else
in the entire world

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.870
and this

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:32.110
is exactly how you act
when you're terrified

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.410
and,i mean,i can't blame you

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.440
it's just

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.270
what?

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:51.870
i wish you would drop the
show and be my brother again

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:53.740
cause

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.770
just 'cause

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.170
all right,we'll hole up

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.170
cover our scent so he can't track us,

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.340
and wait the night out here

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.770
your scent's all over the cellphone store

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.610

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.410

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.710
i'd rather you come to me
what's the matter,gordo?

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.570

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.640

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:17.310

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.740
- gordon,let the girl go.
- bye,dean.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.840
gordon! don't do this.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.070
you don't kill innocent people.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.510
you're still a hunter.

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:41.970
no...

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.470
i'm a monster.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.200
hey,we got you.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.730
don't worry. we're gonna
get you out of here.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.500

watch your head.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.130
sam,stay close.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.800
- sam!

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.330

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.500
gordon...

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:57.170
you got me where you want me.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.070
you might as well come out and fight!

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.400
i'm right here,sam.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.930
what's the matter,sammy?

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.400
so,this is really the way
you want to do it,huh?

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.700
damn right i do.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.770
you have no idea what i faced...

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.970
to get here.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.100
i lost everything...

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.530
my life.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:39.570
but it's worth it cause
i'm finally gonna kill

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.070
the most dangerous thing i ever hunted.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.100
you're not human,sam.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.900
look who's talking.

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:52.360
you're right.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.430
i'm a bloodthirsty killer.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:57.000
- don't talk about it like you don't have a choice.
- i don't.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:58.800
yes,you do,gordon.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.130
you didn't kill that girl.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.400
no,i didn't.

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:07.230
i did something much,much worse.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.030
i got to hand it to you,sam.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.670
you got a lot of people fooled,

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.070
but,see,i know the truth.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:43.000
i know what it's like.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:46.630
we're the same now,you and me.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:50.000
i know how it is

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:53.000
walking around with something
evil inside you.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.070
it's just too bad you won't
do the right thing

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.770
and kill yourself.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.870
i'm gonna...

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.230
as soon as i'm done with you.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.500
two last good deeds...

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.700
killing you...

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.630
and killing myself.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.670
no!

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:58.330
you just charged a super-vamped-out
gordon with no weapon.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.200
that's a little reckless,don't you think?

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.030
- there you go.
- thanks.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.360
figure out what's making that rattle?

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.500
not yet.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.460
give me a box wrench,would you?

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.660
yeah.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.160
- there you go.
- thanks.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.230
sam.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.260
- wrong one?
- no,come here for a second.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.630
yeah.

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:47.500
this rattle could be a couple of things.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.030
i'm thinking it's an out-of-tune car.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:53.530
okay.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.200
all right,see this thing?

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:56.700
it's a valve cover.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.100
inside are all the parts that are on the head.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.030
hand me that socket wrench.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.700
all right,you with me so far?

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.360
yeah,uh,valve cover covers the heads.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.700
very good.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.800
this is your intake manifold,
and on top of it?

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:14.160
it's,uh,a carburetor.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.960
carburetor... very good.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.830
what's with the auto shop?

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.560
you don't mean you want...

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.460
yeah,i do.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:27.960
you fix it.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.960
dean,you barely let me drive this thing.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.130
well,it's time. you should
know how to fix it.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.830
you're gonna need to know these
things for the future.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:47.030
and,besides,that's my job,right?

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.300
show my little brother the ropes.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.960
put your shoulder into it.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
